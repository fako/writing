A law that step by step debolishes limited liability.
As long as a company does business in a (democratic) country where limited liability is still possible the clause is void,
unless there is voluntary cooperation.
This way very little will change in the beginning, but as the world comes to grip with limited liability pressure from democracies will hold companies liable again.
