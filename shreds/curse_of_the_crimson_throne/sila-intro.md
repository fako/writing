A day in the life of Sila Javatai
=================================

In the early morning the sun rises just above the houses of the city of Korvosa,
and as the sunlight crosses a small courtyard in the south of this city, 
it falls through a window on the face of Sila Javatai, 
who lies awake in her bed.
The light sparkles on one of her tears.
She has been thinking about her former master Taigam Ojutai, who only two weeks ago was murdered in an alley.
Taigam was like a father to Sila. He has tought her everything she knows.
How to defend herself against thugs and men with wrong ideas.
How to sing the songs of Irori, The Enlightened One. 
How to climb, jump and summersault out of harms way.
But it's not his endless patience during these lessons she's missing the most.
It's his warm voice when he speaks.
It's his unrelentless faith in the good of all people.
It's his small amused smile whenever he disagrees with her.

Sila gets out of bed and prays to Irori for the strength to deal with all the emotions that are going on inside her, 
as well as the strength to keep Taigam's fighting school running.
As Taigam's best pupil it falls upon her shoulders to continue the traditions and wisdom Taigam lived by.
However some of the men seem to think that they are more suitable to lead the school
and the last few trainings have been full of quarrel and second guessing her decisions.
Especially Danguan is giving her a hard time.
It's difficult to win the respect of people in general,
but it's even harder when they still seem to resent your rejection of their romantic intents.

However she feels a lot better after lighting a candle to honor Taigam
and singing a mantra with healing powers for herself.
It's time to go to the market.
As Sila approaches the busy market square she pulls her hood further over her head.
She doesn't like being in crowded places, especially the ones where a lot of people want something from her.
Like wealthy merchants pushing their wares, constantly demanding her to look at trinklets that do nothing, but look pretty.
She wouldn't be able to afford jewelry anyway even if she wanted to.
The fat, loud and complacent traders seem truly convinced that their silver rings and necklesses will miracably improve her life.
Unfortunately silver will not fill her belly and that's actually all she is looking for: something to ease her hunger.
When she walks passed a basket of apples, and she sees the merchant is busy bargaining with a client, she takes the opportunity.
Quickly she snatches two apples and walks on as if nothing happened, but ready to make a run for it.
After a few paces she sighs in relief. Her heart is still pounding, but she can be sure she got away with it.
Ever since she had to pay for Taigam's funeral she has been struggeling to make ends meet.
But what was she to do? Bury Taigam in nothing but cloth and relinquish a ceremony by Irori priests that Taigam deserved so much?
Hell no!
Besides most people selling on this market aren't going to miss a few apples, some bread and a stump of cheese.
She only pays Kiora, the old lady selling her some left over meat for a reasonable price, even though it is a hefty expense on Sila's budget.
Not only does Kiora need the money. Irori wouldn't approve if the life of an animal wasn't paid for in full.

As Sila leaves the market to see her brother she can't resist making a detour to walk past The Entwined Horns,
a pawn shop just across the river.
In it's shop window lie two magnificent wakazashi's.
These short blades are non other than the personal weapons of master Taigam.
Everytime she sees them Sila can only admire the craft that went into these blades as well as the grace with which Taigam would wield them.
Recently however not only admiration, but also a name flashes through her mind. Gaedren Lamm.
According to the shop owner that man sold these precious blades to him, and knowing that Taigam would never give up these weapons willingly,
Gaedren Lamm must know more about the death of Taigam Ojutai.
He would know the murderers, if he didn't commit the crime and stole the swords himself.
Sila swears to find this man in order to avenge the cowardly attack on Taigam's life.
Whoever did it might have cought her master by surprise, but she will be sure not to show her back, but the edge of her blades instead. 
It pains Sila to leave the wakazashi's behind and visit her brother, but she can't afford to buy them for now.
One day they will get an honorouble home with her. That is certain.

As she arrives at the home of her brother her niece and nephew come to greet her.
It is great to see them and even though she would like nothing more than to spend more time with them.
She has to face her brother who is standing in the doorway of his house.
Arms folded over each other and with an expression that clearly shows he is furious with her.
Pago skolds at her when she has to admit, that she can't give him the money she owes him.
She tries to explain she needed the money for the funeral and just hasn't been able to convince others to share the costs with her.
But her brother, incensitive as always, won't hear anything of it. He doesn't want to see her until she pays him back.
With tears in her eyes Sila storms out of the house.
Why will nobody help her?

Without even going home to drop her groceries Sila starts climbing a house to get to its roof. 
Once on top she gets to a whole different part of the city.
The Shingles are houses, roads and pathways on top of Korvosa's most busy neighboorhoods.
Here she can find the people who may provide her with work that might not be as honorouble as running a martial arts school,
but it pays a lot better. Usually her skills to silently enter through closed doors are in high demand.
Tonight however she seems out of luck and she's only asked to do risky jobs that aren't paid that well.
She thanks her contacts for their effort, but desillusioned she climbs down to the street and heads home not knowing how to solve her money problems.

Once home she finds a dagger in the post of her door with a note pinned underneath it.
It reads that somebody wants to meet her.
This person knows where Gaedren Lamm the suspected murderer of Taigam is hiding.
Like Sila this person wants Gaedren to face justice.
It's the best news she has heard all day.
