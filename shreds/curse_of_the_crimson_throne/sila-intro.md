A day in the life of Sila Javatai
=================================

In the early morning the sun rises just above the houses of the city of Korvosa,
and as the sunlight crosses a small courtyard in the south of this city, 
it falls through a window on the face of Sila Javatai, 
who lies awake in her bed.
The light sparkles on one of her tears.
She has been thinking about her former master Taigam Ojutai, who only two weeks ago was murdered in an alley.
Taigam was like a father to Sila. He has tought her everything she knows.
How to defend herself against thugs and men with wrong ideas.
How to sing the songs of Irori, The Enlightened One. 
How to climb, jump and summersault out of harms way.
But it's not his endless patience during these lessons she's missing the most.
It's his warm voice when he speaks.
It's his unrelentless faith in the good of all people.
It's his small amused smile whenever he disagrees with her.

Sila gets out of bed and prays to Irori for the strength to deal with all the emotions that are going on inside her, 
as well as the strength to keep Taigam's fighting school running.
As Taigam's best pupil it falls upon her shoulders to continue the traditions and wisdom Taigam lived by.
However some of the men seem to think that they are more suitable to lead the school
and the last few trainings have been full of quarrel and second guessing her decisions.
Especially Danguan is giving her a hard time.
It's difficult to win the respect of people in general,
but it's even harder when they still seem to resent your rejection of their romantic intents.

However she feels a lot better after lighting a candle to honor Taigam
and singing a mantra with healing powers for herself.
It's time to go to the market.
