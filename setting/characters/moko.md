Moko (The One)
==============

This is the main character. He develops from being a vengeful short sighted individual into a wise thoughtful man, 
who takes his role in society as judge with the utmost vigilance.


Power 
-----

Speak justice fairly even in very complex cases. It is up to others to carry out any judgements.


Storyline
---------

There are a few steps of development that Moko goes through in the story:
* Moko believes he is destined to kill The Savage King
* Moko can only think about revenge for his brother's death
* Moko is willing to break the law to get his revenge, believing that this is justified
* Moko learns he can control the dragon named Cerof
* Moko starts to doubt whether he is truly "the one" and that the world is different than he believed

There are also some things that he could learn, but that do not have a corresponding story event yet:
* Base rate fallacy
* Whataboutism
* Falsification
* Moko realises that not everything is as it seems
* Moko realises that some decisions once made can't be undone
* Moko realises that with great power comes great responsibility
* Good luck is not equal to extraordinary skill
* Don't blame the circumstances if your own failures are an explanation
* Separation of church and state
* Just because something doesn't suit you doesn't mean you should ignore it (cognitive disonance)
* Context is a major factor in influencing our behavior (like graffiti on walls that incite other criminal behavior)
* We have a perpatual desire to change things in our environment (Thomas Hobbes?)
