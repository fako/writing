Tera (The Artist)
=================

The love of [Moko](the-one.md), but is in turn secretly in love with [Xite](zombie-king.md), who only sporadically answers it.
Sister of [Tirion](the-seer.md).


Power
-----

Posesses one of the strongest super powers, but it's kept secret and therefor she seems to have no special talent, accept drawing beautifully.
Her power is in fact to create very life like paintings, which can become portals to alternative realities when you touch their canvases.
When somebody steps through these portals they see the reality they left behind on the canvas on the other side.

The downside to Tera's power is that creating a world is so complex that she can't possibly control everything.
She regularly has found that worlds she tried to create have turned out differently than she imagined.
In some cases these worlds actually harmed her and she had to step back or create another world in a hurry. 
To escape what she thought would be an amazing world to live in.

Her only way to deal with this problem and create worlds that benefit her is to trust her mother [Sinia](the-queen.md).
Because Sinia can know whether a choice will have a good or bad outcome for the person involved Sinia can help Tera create worlds that benefit her.
Of course Sinia makes sure that these worlds also benefit her.
A reality where Tera and Xite are happily in love with each other is something Tera strongly desires,
but Sinia will keep her away from.
Many paintings that depict Tera and Xite in each others arms stand in a dusty basement, but Tera fears to step through them,
because Sinia refuses to go with her and warns her for suffering.
Instead she waits for Xite to come to her.
This procrastination of Tera's love for Xite only makes it stronger.


Power alternative
-----------------

A big downside for Tera is that only her mother Sinia can turn one of her paintings into a portal.
Therefor she relies a lot on her mother and recents that she can't create the reality that she truly wants.
A reality where she and Xite are happily in love with each other.
Her mother deems a marriage between her daughter and an agent of The Whole unfit.
The many paintings that depict Tera and Xite in each others arms stand in a dusty basement unapproved by Sinia.
The denial of Tera's love for Xite only makes it stronger.
