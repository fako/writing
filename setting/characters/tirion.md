Tirion (The Seer)
=================

Friend of [Moko (The One)](moko.md) and partner in finding the evil [Savage King](xite.md).
A prince, very intelligent, with a love for nature.


Power
-----

Tirion has the blessing and curse of foresight. 
Whenever his father [Sorsen (The Cleric)](sorsen.md) climbs The Tower of Atad to call upon the power of Atad it's Tirion that goes up to help.
Tirion supports his old father on the way down, because Sorsen gets severly weakened when Atad forcefully enters his body.
When Sorsen puts an arm around his son, Tirion can feel some of the power flow into him.
Right after Tirion receives this power he can say exactly what is going to happen before it does.
Tirion uses this foresight to outsmart most people.
However as time passes since the last time Sorsen has spoken to Atad, Tirion's forecasts becomes worse and worse.
Until it's not better than anybodies guess, what the future will hold.

Most things in nature are more predicable than society.
Therefor Tirion's foresight remains accurate a lot longer, when it comes to the natural realm.
Because he's so good at predicting it he favours the natural world over society. 


Storyline
---------

In the beginning Tirion sincerly wants to help [Moko (The One)](moko.md) at defeating [Xite (The Savage King)](xite.md).
The prophecy that Moko is the one comes from him and he full heartly believes it.
In reality his mother [Sinia (The Queen)](sinia.md) tricked Tirion into seeing this prophecy and there is no merit to it.
The true goal of the prophecy is to get rid of Moko once and for all in order for Sinia to rule unchallenged and without boundaries.
If Moko would ever attack Xite he would surely die as The Savage King posseses the power to redirect any attack back to his attacker.
Xite has limited control over this power.
So even though Xite would never want to harm Moko, he would do so by accident if Moko ever voluntarily attacks, because he thinks he's destined for it.
However [Xite (The Savage King)](xite.md) learned about the ruse from [The Queen](sinia.md) through the princes [Tera (The Artist)](tera.md), who is in love with him.
To protect Moko, Xite fled the city and Tirion and Moko have been chasing him ever since.
It turns out to be very hard to find Xite, partly because he doesn't want to be found and partly because Tera keeps helping him.

So [Moko (The One)](moko.md) and Tirion are struggeling to fulfill their (supposed) purpose, but at the beginning of part I, Tirion has a masterplan to find and kill Moko once and for all.
They set out to execute the plan, but instead of succeeding Tirion's father dies in the effort.
Tirion also accidently discovers that the prophecy is fake and that his mother [Sinia (The Queen)](sinia.md) is behind it all.
On top of that Tirion looses his power to foresee the future, because it stems from his father talking to the God Atad.

Desillusioned and devasted by the loss of his father as well as his powers, Tirion wants to take his suffering out on somebody and chooses his mother. 
She seems to be the source of his misery as she knew the mission that caused his father (and her husband's) death was a hoax.
Nonetheless she did nothing to keep his father from danger, and adding hurt to injury, she is even happy about being freed from her marriage, as it allows the relation with her lover to become more public.
At the end of part II Tirion betrays [Moko (The One)](moko.md) by killing him and takes over the rule from [Sinia (The Queen)](sinia.md). 
However he doesn't realize that Sinia together with [Tera (The Artist)](tera.md) is fleeing to an alternate dimension, created by Tera and Sinia, where Moko as well as his father are still alive. In that world lives another Tirion who is blessed with ignorance about his mother's plans.
