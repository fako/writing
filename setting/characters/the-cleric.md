Power
-----

Sorsen's power is to know everything that has happened in a region, but as his knowledge ages he needs to refresh it by calling upon Atad.
A mysterious power that enters his mind so forcefully that it knocks him out.
Sorsen calls upon Atad by climbing its tower and meditating at the highest point.
The higher Sorsen meditates the more he gets to know about the world, because the radius from which he draws the knowledge increases.
Sorsen is a devoted man to Atad and feels a moral obligation to bring the knowledge of Atad to the world.
