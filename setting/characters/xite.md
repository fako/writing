Xite (The Savage King)
=========================

Xite is believed to be the ultimate evil and a danger to the world itself.
It is thought that wherever Xite goes a horde of killing and plundering barbarians follow.
That's why he's better known as "The Savage King" a title that strikes fear into the hearts of everybody.
The fact that nobody really knows what he looks like adds to the mystery of Xite and the fear surrounding him.


Power
-----

Any violent (deadly) act towards him he instinctly turns against his attacker, but he's unable to initiate an attack himself as well as unable to turn off these reflexes.


Storyline
---------

There are two misconceptions around Xite and the barbarians that become evident in part II:
* The barbarians are normal people that suddenly found themselves in an unknown world without food or shelter. Their attacks are a way to survive.
* Xite does not lead the barbarians, but follows them and stands between them and their targets. Whichever barbarian attacks Xite he kills in self defence.

There are two causes for the misunderstandings around Xite's intentions:
* [Tirion (The Seer)](tirion.md) sees death and destruction in the future around Xite as well as large groups of barbarians. However he doesn't realize that Xite is searching for these violent groups on his own and isn't rallying them.
* [Sinia (The Queen)](sinia.md) is well aware that Xite is not a real danger to the world. However she hopes that [Moko (The One)](moko.md) will die when fighting him and she dislikes that her daughter [Tera (The Artist)](tera.md) is in love with him. Xite is a primitive man that acts on his emotions and instincts and Sinia loaths these character traits, especially in a partner for her beloved daughter. Having Xite as an outcast suits her well.

To protect [Moko (The One)](moko.md) Xite remains in hiding. If Xite and Moko would ever meet than Moko would think he needs to fulfill his false destiny and attack Xite. This would surely lead to Moko's death as Xite would instinctly redirect the attack back to Moko. As Moko starts to doubt the prophecy around his person in part II, he's willing to talk to Xite and Xite doesn't have to run anymore. Before [Sinia (The Queen)](sinia.md) manipulated Moko, Xite en Moko were friends and collegues who were send to the valley to stop Sinia from taking over everything.

[Tera (The Artist)](tera.md) is in love with Xite. He doesn't love her back, but he needs Tera as protection against [Sinia (The Queen)](sinia.md). Sinia would prefer to manipulate Xite as she manipulates [Moko (The One)](moko.md). However as Tera loves Xite she refuses to change anything about him. As long as Tera refuses to paint Xite differently Sinia is powerless to change him.
