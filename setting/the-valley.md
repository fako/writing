The Valley
==========

To most characters "The Valley" is synonym to "The World".
For all practical purposes nothing outside of it exists.
This text describes some note worthy sites inside The Valley,
how these sites developed into what they are today and which politics are involved.



The City of Terniten
---------------------

This wonderous city is a distributed city.
Instead of having a city center and slowly expanding over time, this city is vastly spread out across the entire Valley.
People can "jump" from sight to sight inside the city through teleportation portals.
It is for instance possible to jump from The Palace to The Tower and back.
There is some urban area and farm land directly around portals, but between them there are large patches of wilderness
and no roads connect sights within Terniten directly.
Most people don't dare to venture into the wilderness.
However instead of traversing the wilderness, people can travel between sights in the city simply by walking through these portals,
which are guarded by the city guards and can only be used against a fee.
One practical draw back of these portals is that not every portal is connected to every other portal.
If you want to get to a location at the edge of The Valley from a location in the center,
then it may take a few jumps through multiple portals to get to your destination.
Overall however teleportation portals make life easier and safer in Terniten.
Having access to them or not makes a big difference in the prosperity of individuals as they enable people to move around across large distances easily.

The family that makes the portal network within Terniten possible is headed by Lorawyn.
Lorawyn's superpower is to transfer thoughts through the wind.
By concentrating she can charge the air with a thought. After which this thought can travel as the air moves: by wind,
the air currents created by birds, or even those of insects.
As a thought arrives at the destination it manifests as an idea.
The receiver of this idea is often not aware of its origin and will interpreted it as an original thought of their own.
Lorawyn's power is at the heart of the functioning of Terniten's portals,
but Lorawyn power couldn't possibly make the portals work if it wasn't for the powers of her partner Pystepaco and child Codideen.
Pystepaco can make a copy of anything, while Codideen can change the structure of things into a different structure.
He can for instance change the structure of a tree from wood into stone and back again.
Essentialy for the portals Codideen can change anything into "thoughts" and back again.
When stepping through a portal Pystepaco's power creates multiple copies of a person and Codideen's power translates these copies into many different thoughts.
These thoughts can then be transfered by Lorawyn's power and finally are translated back into a single person by Codideen's power at the destination.
Because multiple copies get send through the wind a complete person can always be constructed from the thoughts that make the journey safely.
Even though some thoughts may get lost or get misformed while traveling.
Especially thoughts that make up a person's mind have the tendency to stick to other people that these thoughts encounter on the way.
These thoughts remain in the minds of other people where they can continue to exist as ideas for a long time,
while they were supposed to move to the destination portal to reunite with the mind of the person who's traveling.

Lorawyn, Pystepaco and Codideen don't need to be present at the portals all the time to make them work.
Pystepaco made copies of the powers of his family,
while Codideen translated the powers into the stone structures people got to know as portals.
However the copies of these powers still rely on Lorawyn, Pystepaco and Codideen to live.
They won't function on their own.

All in all the portals make a lot of copies of a person to make it safe to transfer them.
At the destination however only a single person steps out of the portal.
What happens to all the other copies?
Codideen does translate these thoughts back into bodies and minds,
but because the thoughts of a mind are easily lost it often happens that only the body gets reconstructed and the mind is lost forever.
When even the thoughts of a body are incomplete it may happen that these, often mindless bodies, are missing limbs or are otherwise malformed.
Fortunately these imperfect copies don't live very long, because the portals are build on top of large underground caverns.
When the copies get reconstructed they immediately fall to their death.
Another child from Lorawyn and Pystepaco named Burte is a super strong, super fast and super stupid woman.
Her job is to get rid of these bodies as they slowly pile up at the bottom of the chasms.
Due to her speed and strength, this is no problem at all.


Queen Sinia's Rule
------------------

For every choice in life Sinia knows whether it will have a good or a bad outcome.
Because of this her subjects often seek her advice in all sorts of issues.
From settling quarrels in families to handling matters of state, Sinia is consulted in most cases,
because her proposed solutions always lead to satisfaction.
It easy to see how her subjects adore her and her rule is completely uncontested.
The Valley used to be democratic, but it was Sinia who convinced people that making her queen would make everybody happier.
And even though it can't be contested that satisfaction has risen under her rule,
a complete lack of democratic control is slowly rotting society in The Valley from the inside out.

This rot comes from the fact that Sinia doesn't always pick the best option that she knows when you lay a choice before her.
She picks the option that is good for you and best for her and her family.
In a lot of cases the best option for the people involved perfectly align with the best option for Sinia and her family.
However when that is not the case Sinia won't disclose her vested interest in the matter
and act as if the option that best suits her is best for everybody.
Especially in matters of state this is problematic and her advice to make her Queen of The Valley is a great example,
where Sinia abused the almost perfect trust in her.
She knew full well that democratic safeguards were best for society, and there were others who were suspicious of developments towards a monarchy,
but these people didn't dare to cross Sinia anymore.
At that point she got consulted in so many issues concerning the population,
that it would be easy for her to socially destroy anybody who stood in her way to power.
For example since all decisions about large trade deals go through her consult,
it would be easy for her to advice against any deals with a particular individual.
Which made all powerful merchants that could have spoken up against the monarchy very nervous.
They didn't need to ask Sinia to know it was in their best interest to get along with the monarchy and profit while the music was still playing.

Although her role as Queen Consult is by far the most prevalent way for Sinia to exercise control in The Valley,
there is another more secretive way in which Queen Sinia holds The Valley in her grip.
This is through her daughter Tera, who seems very ordinary compared to other members of the royal family,
but only because she is so powerful that her abilities are kept deeply secret.
Not only from the public, but from other members of the royal family as well.

Tera is an artist who makes huge lifelike paintings depicting society as she would like to see it.
Together with her mother, Tera can step into these paintings which then become reality.
In a way these paintings act as gateways to alternative realities.
Realities that get shaped by the artist Tera.
Tera and Sinia often work together on what these realities should be,
where the ability of Sinia to know whether a choice will have a good outcome informs Tera's work to make a reality that suits their common interest.
Needless to say some friction between mother and daughter arise when their interests don't align.
Tera is too grown up to believe that her mother always has her best interest at heart
and often doubts her mothers advice even if it is truly in her best interest.
This dynamic mostly plays out around relationships of Tera.
She regularly falls in love with men that ultimately will treat her badly, but any advice against them can meet with scepticism from Tera's side.
Meanwhile Sinia really doesn't want Tera to start a relationship that would threaten the bond between them,
fearing the day that together with a spouse that truly loves her Tera would rebel against her mother and refuse to cooperate entirely.
So Sinia's advice does steer away from such relationships, even if they could bring her daughter happiness.
Meanwhile paintings where Tera depicts herself in a happy relationship end up in storage,
because Sinia refuses to step into them with her daughter, and therefor refuses for them to become reality.

Queen Sinia doesn't hesitate to use the power of her daughter to her full advantage, at the expense of others, when she deems it necessary to protect her own family.
Lorawyn's children both threaten the power of Sinia in their own way.
Burte's sheer strength is a force to recon with.
If she would turn against Sinia, she wouldn't stand a chance in battle.
Fortunately for Sinia, Burte is deeply in love with her son Tirion, who doesn't love Burte as much,
but isn't unwilling to lead her on and make Burte loyal to the royal family.
It helps that Burte's limited intellect makes it easy to manipulate her.
Codideen's power is more difficult to deal with.
He is capable to change the structure of things.
This is essential for the teleportation portals in Terniten, because things needs to change into "thoughts", before Lorawyn can transport them over the wind.
But Codideen's power can also undo any changes that Tera has made in the world,
because he can change the manipulated structures made by Tera back into their authentic form.
To prevent that Codideen uses his power against her, Sinia covinced Tera to depict Codideen not as the young adult he is,
but as a child that doesn't completely master his powers.
For good measure Sinia has made Codideen and Burte believe that their parents are dead and she is the one who will take care of them.
While in reality Tera has turned their mother Lorawyn in a witch, notorious for spreading lies and their father Pystepaco in a tree,
incapable of speech or action on his own.
Lorawyn has been brooding on a way to get back to Sinia and restore her family.


The Zombie Society
------------------

Normally the extra copies of people created by the teleportation portals in Terniten fall to their death.
These bodies get cleaned up by Burte with her super speed and strength,
but as Burte wants to spend time with her love Tirion and Sinia also wants other work done by Burte, it happens that bodies are not removed as often as they should.
As bodies amass directly underneath the portals the corpses may break the fall of a body causing it to survive.
These survivors look exactly like the person they stem from, but they are nothing but empty shells, driven by instincts and more animal than human.
Since portals that fail to kill the disposible bodies remain in function for a while, many of these savages accumulate in the caverns.
As their numbers grow they drive each other deeper into the caverns,
where some may find their way to the surface through cave entrances in the wilderness.
As these orphaned bodies without memories or a sense of identity venture through the jungle they encounter urban areas, that border the wilderness.
Driven by hunger they will often steal from or assault the local population,
who are poor people without prospects or the ability to settle in safer areas.
These people bear the consequences from an easier way to travel enjoyed by a few.

For Sinia and Tera it is a problem that there is a constant influx of mindless savage clones into their society.
When exact copies of the royal family are turning havoc in the urban areas terrorizing the local population,
then that's not good for the royal families image.
By the very nature of Tera's power solving this problem is harder as it seems.
For Tera to change something she has to depict it. Anything she doesn't depict will remain the same.
However she can't depict something that she wants to disappear as this would look like nothing
and anything that isn't on her paintings remains the same.
Leaving out the clones in her paintings therefore would only lead to them remaining as they are and therefore remain a problem.
Sinia's and Tera's solution is to make the clones appear as zombies.
Making the clones look like evil monsters rallies the population of The Valley against them,
which try to destroy them on sight and effectively kill the clones, who have done nothing but survive, while they weren't supposed to.

The zombies are also an opportunity for Lorawyn to try and dethrone Sinia.
Since the zombies are mindless for a large part and otherwise mentally weak due to hunger and suffering,
they make easy targets for Lorawyn to manipulate their thoughts.
She often reinforces the zombies desire to loot and steel from the people living in Terniten.
Hoping that a massive attack on the city will lead to an opening in the defenses that allow her to get back her children.
To increase her chances of success she asks Pystepaco to make copies of the zombies that she can easily manipulate.
This way hordes of zombies do occassionally swamp the city defenses.
These attacks are a grave concern to Terniten's population who, in the increase of zombie organization,
see the rise of a Zombie King from the darkness bend on their destruction.
Not knowing that a Zombie Queen would be a more adequate description.
So far Lorawyn has been able to get into the city unseen during an attack,
but her appearance of a witch has scared her children away, when she tries to get in contact.
Codideen could help her to shed the false form of course, but he just doesn't trust the frightful woman.

Not all zombies are part of this struggle between Lorawyn and Sinia.
Because the zombies are actually humans that experience all emotions,
they are often as scared of inhabitants of The Valley as the inhabitants are scared of the zombies.
This leads to some zombies leading secluded lives in the wilderness, learning how to forage,
and instead of suffering a violent death in an attack on Terniten, even reproduce amongst themselves.
Initially born like any normal human being, the children that come from zombies can sometimes be seen playing between the dead from afar,
which gives rise to many legends about how the ghosts of naughty children haunt the world forever.
These children are of course a risk to Sinia and Tera if anybody was to discover their true origin.
Therefore whenever the royal duo steps into a new reality, they make sure these humans look zombie too.

Over many decades the zombie society has become more elaborate than wild animals living side by side.
The zombies form groups with their own simpel verbal language and with the strong as well as the cunning leading these packs.
New clones that come stumbling from the caverns are not always hunted for their meat,
but may get initiated into the culture of the group they encounter.
One particular group has been especially successful at surviving through their culture over the years.
These zombies send their children into the urban areas, which unintentionally gives these children an edge in survival.
By pure coincedence some of these children happen to be inside the city when Sinia and Tera shift reality.
However as Tera failed to depict any zombies inside these cities on her painting, these children kept their human appearance.
This allowed a small group of zombie children to grow up as adults with a human appearance, but a zombie heart, loyal only to their own survival.
Being condemned to stealing from an early age these children have become the most notorious gang of criminals in Terniten.
As the gang harvests success and the spoils get shared with their zombie family, more and more zombies have become loyal to this gang.


Central's Concern
-----------------

It is Central's goal to fairly divide energy across The Whole and stimulate efficient use of that energy.
The Valley is a relatively small part of The Whole.
Since The Valley is such a minor part of Central's regulatory domain it often slips from Central's attention.
Especially because Central has a small amount of agents working for it.
Because of the rather modest mingling of Central in The Valley's affairs,
not many people inside The Valley have ever encountered a Central agent.
That means for most Central is like any other thing outside The Valley,
because people don't know it, it might as well not exist at all.

This is not the case for Queen Sinia however, who secretly does everything in her power to stop and oppose Central.
It has not escaped Central's attention that The City of Terniten is consuming fast amounts of energy,
to power up its rather insufficient network of portals to travel between places.
Strongly doubting the need for such energy usage, and suspecting that something is wrong,
Central has send out two of its best agents to The Valley to investigate.
Xite is an agent with the power to end the life of anybody with his bare hands, no matter how powerful they are.
When Xite ends a life the energy contained by this individual is released and becomes available to The Whole,
where it may find another way to manifest in a physical form.
But Xite can only take a life in self defense.
Somebody needs to act violently towards Xite, or he can't kill at all.
When somebody does act violently towards him, he has no choice but to respond with a kill.
He does this instinctively and has no control over these lethal reflexes.
Sometimes Xite is not even aware of an attack, before he responds to it with his supernatural killing blows.
Inside the wilderness of The Valley there are plenty of mindless clones that naively attack Xite,
unaware that it will be the last thing they do.

The cunning like The Royal Family stay far away from Xite, which makes him harmless, but Central's second agent is not so easy to evade.
This second agent is called Moko and his power is to end a life not with his bare hands, but with his consideration.
When Moko reasons that your life should end it will end immediatelly.
This is a power that Sinia deeply fears, as it is her doing that The City of Terniten consumes so much energy.
If Moko becomes aware of this and concludes it will be best for The Whole if Queen Sinia disappears, no amount of power, manipulation or influence can safe her.

Which brings us to Queen Sinia's final ruse.
Together with her daughter, she made another shift in reality, as soon as the agents arrived in The Valley.
In this reality Moko believes that he is The One. A saviour who will redeem The Valley from the Zombie King and its hordes.
However instead of going after the crime lord who has been coordinating zombie attacks for personal gain,
Queen Sinia holds up the appearance that Xite is the Zombie King and should be attacked on sight,
before he is able to unleash his doom unto the world.
This shift changed Moko. From a thoughtful considerate person, that takes the complexity of The Whole into account.
Into a vengeful hot head ready to fulfill his superficial fake destiny.
Unaware that if he would ever try to attack his collegue Xite, it would end his life like any other and prolong Queen Sinia's unjust rule.
