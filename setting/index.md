The Valley (aka the world)
--------------------------

Everything that the characters have ever known.


Atad
----

Atad is a mysterious force that seems to grant powers to certain individuals in The Valley.
It has a spiritual status and gets worshipped.


The City of Terniten
---------------------

In this city people can teleport between houses, but they can't teleport from every house to every other house.
Instead people need to "jump" from house to house and visit multiple intermediate houses to get to their destination.
This means that if you live in Terniten random people appear in your house at random times, who may stay for a chat or listen in on conversations.
So people travel fast within the city, but they also have a lack of privacy.
News tends to spread fast in Terniten, because people keep each other posted while traveling.

Because of its nature Terniten is unlike any city known on Earth. It's vastly spread out across the entire Valley.
In between different locations within the city are large patches of wildernis where most people don't dare to venture.
Apart from this wildernis there are some crime invested parts, where most people won't go unless they absolutely have to be there.


The Wilds
---------

Everything outside of The City of Terniten, but inside The Valley.


The Savages
-----------

A group of poor people that live in misery, but are the driving force behind the wealth of The City of Terniten.
Their home is The Wilds, but they come to the city to work every day.


The Tower of Atad
-----------------

This tower lies in the middle of The Valley at its deepest point and is therefore the center of the world to the characters.
It acts as a place of worship to Atad.

At the top of this tower is a whole, that goes straight through the entire tower and forms a seemingly endless pit, that people call "the source".
This pit is named like this, because it is tought to lead straight to the source of all life.
The legend goes that the deep dark whole at the center of their world is the origin of that world.
The death are thrown into this pit, because it is believed that if the dead return to the source, they will one day return to the world.


Sorsen
------

A man who knows everything that has happened in the world, but as his knowledge ages he needs to refresh it by calling upon Atad.
A mysterious power that enters his mind so forcefully that it knocks him out.
Sorsen calls upon Atad by climbing its tower and meditating at the highest point.
The higher Sorsen meditates the more he gets to know about the world.
Sorsen is a devoted man to Atad and feels a moral obligation to bring the knowledge of Atad to the world.


Tirion
------

Son of Sorsen. Whenever his father climbs The Tower of Atad to call upon the power of Atad it's Tirion that goes up to help.
Tirion supports his old father on the way down, because Sorsen gets severly weakened when Atad forcefully enters his body.
When Sorsen puts an arm around his son, Tirion can feel some of the power flow into him.
The Atad gives him the blessing and curse of foresight. For some time Tirion can say exactly what is going to happen before it does.
Tirion uses this foresight to outsmart most people.


Burte
------

A woman of infinite strength, speed and stupidity who handles all the choires in the city that no else can or will do.
Girlfriend of Tirion.
She hates men and many men hate her, because she is clearly superior to them.


Sinia
-----

Queen of The City of Terniten and mother to Tirion and Tera.

Sinia's power is to know what is right and what is wrong.
In a way she looks into the future like Tirion, but instead of knowing what will happen she knows whether a choice will have a good or a bad outcome.
Sinia is seen as a benevolent ruler, who has brought prosperity and has guided many people to a happy fulfilling life.
However her dark side is that Sinia benefits most from the choices that Sinia makes herself and recommends to others.
The barbarians are often drawing the short end and suffer under Sinia's rule, without realising she is causing their suffering.


Xite
----

Xite is believed to be the ultimate evil and a danger to the world itself.
It is thought that wherever Xite goes a horde of killing and plundering barbarians follow.
That's why he's better known as "The Savage King" a title that strikes fear into the hearts of everybody.
The fact that nobody really knows what he looks like adds to the mystery of Xite and the fear surrounding him.


Tera
----

Sister of Tirion.

Posesses one of the strongest super powers, but it's kept secret and therefor she seems to have no special talent, accept drawing beautifully.
Her power is in fact to create very life like paintings, which can become portals to alternative realities when you touch their canvases.
When somebody steps through these portals they see the reality they left behind on the canvas on the other side.

A big downside for Tera is that only her mother Sinia can turn one of her paintings into a portal.
Therefor she relies a lot on her mother and recents that she can't create the reality that she truly wants.
A reality where she and The Savage King are happily in love with each other.
Her mother deems a marriage between her daughter and a barbarian unfit.
The many paintings that depict Tera and The Savage King in each others arms stand in a dusty basement unapproved by Sinia.
The denial of Tera's love for The Savage King only makes it stronger.


House of Nitra
--------------

Sorsen, Tirion, Tera, Sinia and Burte (by marriage) are all part of the House of Nitra.


Moko
----

A rightuous man. Friend of Tirion. Main character of the story.


Encinneco
---------

Brother of Moko who died not very long ago.


The Top of the World
--------------------

A point on the edge of the world that is higher than The Tower of Atad.
When Sorsen climbs a mountain to refresh his knowledge and reaches this point, The Atad that strikes him comes from outside The Valley.
As Tirion gets the knowledge from his father like he always does he goes insane.
