The Valley (aka the world)
--------------------------

Everything that the characters have ever known.


Atad
----

Atad is a mysterious force that seems to grant powers to certain individuals in The Valley.
It has a spiritual status and gets worshipped.


The City of Terniten
---------------------

In this city people can teleport between houses, but they can't teleport from every house to every other house.
Instead people need to "jump" from house to house and visit multiple intermediate houses to get to their destination.
This means that if you live in Terniten random people appear in your house at random times, who may stay for a chat or listen in on conversations.
So people travel fast within the city, but they also have a lack of privacy.
News tends to spread fast in Terniten, because people keep each other posted while traveling.

Because of its nature Terniten is unlike any city known on Earth. It's vastly spread out across the entire Valley.
In between different locations within the city are large patches of wildernis where most people don't dare to venture.
Apart from this wildernis there are some crime invested parts, where most people won't go unless they absolutely have to be there.


The Tower of Atad
-----------------

This tower lies in the middle of The Valley at its deepest point and is therefore the center of the world.
It acts as a place of worship to Atad.

At the top of this tower is a whole, that goes straight through the entire tower and forms a seemingly endless pit, that people call "the source".
The pit is tought to lead straight to the source of all life,
because to the people living inside The Valley it seems that the deep dark whole at the center of their world is the origin of that world.
The death are thrown into this pit, because it is believed that if the dead return to the source, they will one day return to the world.


Sorsen
------

A man who knows everything that has happened in the world, but as his knowledge ages he needs to refresh it by calling upon Atad.
A mysterious power that enters his mind so forcefully that it knocks him out.
Sorsen calls upon Atad by climbing its tower and meditating at the highest point.
The higher Sorsen meditates the more he gets to know about the world.
Sorsen is a devoted man to Atad and feels a moral obligation to bring the knowledge of Atad to the world.


Tirdecpion
----------

Son of Sorsen. Whenever his father climbed The Tower of Atad to call upon the power of Atad it's Tirdecpion that meets him at the tower's base.
Tirdecpion supports his old father who got severly weakened when Atad forcefully entered his body.
When Sorsen puts an arm around his son Tirdecpion can feel some of the power flow into him.
The Atad gives him the blessing and curse of foresight. For some time Tirdecpion can say exactly what is going to happen before it does.

Smartest man in the world and hero of The City.
He uses the knowledge from his father to outsmart everybody.


Burte
------

A woman of infinite strength, speed and stupidity who handles all the choires in the city that no monkey can or will do.
Girlfriend of Tirdecpion.
She hates men and many men hate her, because she is clearly superior to them.


Regne Otar
----------

Mother of Tirdecpion.

She creates very life like paintings, which are in fact portals to alternative realities.
When somebody steps through these portals they see the reality they left behind on the canvas.
However as soon as somebody steps through the image very slowly starts to crumble and fall apart, until nothing but a white canvas is left behind
and the original reality is destroyed.
Cimsidirn is trusted to decide which reality should be *the* reality and is the only one who gets to step through the paintings.


House of Nitra
--------------

The All Knowing, Tirdecpion, Regne and Burte (by marriage) are all part of the House of Nitra.


House of Wal
------------

A household in The City who are looking to protect The Monkeys from evil powers.


The Monkeys
-----------

A group of poor people that live in misery, but are the driving force behind the wealth of The City.
Their home is The Jungle, but they come to the city to work every day.


Cerof Wal
---------

A strong rightuous man from the House of Wal.
Friend of Tirdecpion.


Cetisuj Wal
----------

A considerate honest women from the House of Wal


The Jungle
----------

Everything outside of The City.


The Monkey King
---------------

Somebody who has found happiness, but is misunderstood and seen as the enemy.
He never comes to The City and what is not known is not loved, but all monkeys admire him. 


Xael (aka Eagle Eye)
--------------------

The only person originally from The City who ventures out into The Jungle. 
He is a man who sees everything, but is blinded by his hate for The Monkey King, 
who to him represents everything that is vile.

What does his super power stand for?


Cimsidirn Otar (Scrator Dinimi)
-------------------------------

King of The City and stepfather to Tirdecpion, who recents him. Cimsidirn is powerful because people trust his judgements above all others.
He tells the story that people are superior to monkeys.


The Top of the World
--------------------

A point on the edge of the world that is higher than The Tower of Atam.
When The All Knowing climbs a mountain to refresh his knowledge and reaches this point, The Atad that strikes him comes from outside The Valley.
As Tirdecpion gets the knowledge from his father like he always does he goes insane.
