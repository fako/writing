The Valley
----------

The world where the stories take place.
Locations, developments and politics described in more detail in [The Valley](the-valley.md)


Atad
----

Atad is a mysterious force that seems to grant powers to certain individuals in The Valley.
It has a spiritual status and gets worshipped.

The Tower of Atad is a tower that lies in the middle of The Valley at its deepest point
and is therefore the center of the world to the characters.
It acts as a place of worship to Atad.


There is a point on the edge of the world that is even higher than The Tower of Atad.
When Sorsen climbs a mountain to refresh his knowledge and reaches this point, The Atad that strikes him comes from outside The Valley.
As Tirion gets the knowledge from his father like he always does he goes insane.
