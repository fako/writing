The Valley (aka the world)
--------------------------

Everything that the characters have ever known.


The All Knowing
---------------

A man who knows what is happening in the world, but as his knowledge ages he needs to refresh it by calling upon Atad.
A mysterious power that enters his mind so forcefully that it knocks him out.
In his dreams he sees visions given to him by Atad.

What is the motivation for The All Knowing to climb that tower time and time again?
What exactly is missing from Atad and is an unknown-unknown? Will it be obvious to the readers that something is "off"? This should feed the madness of Tirdecpion (see below)


The City of Terniten
---------------------

Terniten lies in the middle of The Valley at its deepest point and is therefore the center of the world.

In The City people can teleport between houses, but they can't teleport from every house to every other house.
Instead people need to "jump" from house to house and visit multiple intermediate houses to get to their destination.
This means that if you live in The City random people appear in your house at random times, who may stay for a chat or listen in on conversations.
So people travel fast within the city, but they also have a lack of privacy.
News tends to spread fast in Terniten, because people keep each other posted are share news while traveling.


The Tower of Atad
-----------------

A huge tower that forms the center of the City and has its base on the lowest point in The Valley.
In the Tower of Atad, The All Knowing ascends to learn what is happening in the world.
The higher the tower became the more The All Knowing got to know. 


Tirdecpion
----------

Son of The All Knowing. Smartest man in the world and hero of The City.
He uses the knowledge from his father to outsmart everybody.

What are his goals? What does he want to achieve?


Burte
------

A woman of infinite strength, speed and stupidity who handles all the choires in the city that no monkey can or will do.
Girlfriend of Tirdecpion.
She hates men and many men hate her, because she is clearly superior to them.


Regne Otar
----------

Mother of Tirdecpion.

She creates very life like paintings, which are in fact portals to alternative realities.
When somebody steps through these portals they see the reality they left behind on the canvas.
However as soon as somebody steps through the image very slowly starts to crumble and fall apart, until nothing but a white canvas is left behind
and the original reality is destroyed.
Cimsidirn is trusted to decide which reality should be *the* reality and is the only one who gets to step through the paintings.


House of Nitra
--------------

The All Knowing, Tirdecpion, Regne and Burte (by marriage) are all part of the House of Nitra.


House of Wal
------------

A household in The City who are looking to protect The Monkeys from evil powers.


The Monkeys
-----------

A group of poor people that live in misery, but are the driving force behind the wealth of The City.
Their home is The Jungle, but they come to the city to work every day.


Cerof Wal
---------

A strong rightuous man from the House of Wal.
Friend of Tirdecpion.


Cetisuj Wal
----------

A considerate honest women from the House of Wal


The Jungle
----------

Everything outside of The City.


The Monkey King
---------------

Somebody who has found happiness, but is misunderstood and seen as the enemy.
He never comes to The City and what is not known is not loved, but all monkeys admire him. 


Xael (aka Eagle Eye)
--------------------

The only person originally from The City who ventures out into The Jungle. 
He is a man who sees everything, but is blinded by his hate for The Monkey King, 
who to him represents everything that is vile.

What does his super power stand for?


Cimsidirn Otar (Scrator Dinimi)
-------------------------------

King of The City and stepfather to Tirdecpion, who recents him. Cimsidirn is powerful because people trust his judgements above all others.
He tells the story that people are superior to monkeys.


The Top of the World
--------------------

A point on the edge of the world that is higher than The Tower of Atam.
When The All Knowing climbs a mountain to refresh his knowledge and reaches this point, The Atad that strikes him comes from outside The Valley.
As Tirdecpion gets the knowledge from his father like he always does he goes insane.
