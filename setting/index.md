The Valley
----------

The world where the stories take place.
Locations, developments and politics described in more detail in [The Valley](the-valley.md)


Atad
----

Atad is a mysterious force that seems to grant powers to certain individuals in The Valley.
It has a spiritual status and gets worshipped.

The Tower of Atad is a tower that lies in the middle of The Valley at its deepest point
and is therefore the center of the world to the characters.
It acts as a place of worship to Atad.


There is a point on the edge of the world that is even higher than The Tower of Atad.
When Sorsen climbs a mountain to refresh his knowledge and reaches this point, The Atad that strikes him comes from outside The Valley.
As Tirion gets the knowledge from his father like he always does he goes insane.

Sinia
-----

Queen of The City of Terniten and mother to Tirion and Tera.

Sinia's power is to know what is right and what is wrong.
In a way she looks into the future like Tirion, but instead of knowing what will happen she knows whether a choice will have a good or a bad outcome.
Sinia is seen as a benevolent ruler, who has brought prosperity and has guided many people to a happy fulfilling life.
However her dark side is that Sinia benefits most from the choices that Sinia makes herself and recommends to others.
The barbarians are often drawing the short end and suffer under Sinia's rule, without realising she is causing their suffering.


Xite
----

Xite is believed to be the ultimate evil and a danger to the world itself.
It is thought that wherever Xite goes a horde of killing and plundering barbarians follow.
That's why he's better known as "The Savage King" a title that strikes fear into the hearts of everybody.
The fact that nobody really knows what he looks like adds to the mystery of Xite and the fear surrounding him.


Tera
----

Sister of Tirion.

Posesses one of the strongest super powers, but it's kept secret and therefor she seems to have no special talent, accept drawing beautifully.
Her power is in fact to create very life like paintings, which can become portals to alternative realities when you touch their canvases.
When somebody steps through these portals they see the reality they left behind on the canvas on the other side.

A big downside for Tera is that only her mother Sinia can turn one of her paintings into a portal.
Therefor she relies a lot on her mother and recents that she can't create the reality that she truly wants.
A reality where she and The Savage King are happily in love with each other.
Her mother deems a marriage between her daughter and a barbarian unfit.
The many paintings that depict Tera and The Savage King in each others arms stand in a dusty basement unapproved by Sinia.
The denial of Tera's love for The Savage King only makes it stronger.


Moko
----

A rightuous man. Friend of Tirion. Main character of the story.
