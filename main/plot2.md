Plot Part II: Rally of the Zombie Hordes
========================================

An overview of important events in part two of the main story. More details about people, places and things in [the setting](../setting/index.md).
Listed events are not yet in chronological order and may still get dropped as the story develops.


Nature of the Zombies
---------------------

Moko and Tira have a discussion about the nature of the Zombies.
Moko fears the violent nature of the Zombies and is surprised that they aren't under regular attack.
Tira argues that people from The City often only get to know a small group from The Zombies.
Namely those that are enraged by the inequality between The Wild and The City and who can't help but express that anger towards The City's inhabitants.
That doesn't mean that most Zombies live violently, it is quite the opposite.
Most Zombies live peacefully and even if Moko and Tira were to expose where they are from, most Zombies wouldn't harm them.

When confronted with a Zombie it doesn't have to be dangerous, even though most danger within the Valley comes from Zombies
