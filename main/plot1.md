Part I: Hunt for the Zombie King
--------------------------------

Everywhere The Zombie King and his followers go they plunder, assault and rape the population.
Moko is The One who is destined to stop The Zombie King and safe The Valley from the barbaric mob that terrorize everybody.
It is foretold that Moko will strike The Zombie King down in an epic battle where everybody else has failed.
Amongst his peers Moko stands in high redeem and people can't wait to get rid of the evil that has haunt their lives for so long.

However at the start of the story Moko does not know where to find The Zombie King.
Whenever Moko hears where he might be he goes there and finds nobody. Moko has never even seen The Zombie King.
It's almost as if he doesn't exist, but the horrible stories coming from the victims of the barbaric pillaging tell otherwise.

Moko gets help to find The Zombie King from his friend Tirion as well as Tirion's father Sorsen.
Sorsen is an old man, but he regularly climbs The Tower to call upon his super powers. Which is to know everything that was.
Through the bond of love that he has with his son, Sorsen transfers some of his knowledge to Tirion,
which awakens his super power to predict the future.
Father and son are a formidable team in the struggle against the savages, with their combined knowledge of past and future,
but so far Tirion hasn't been able to pin point where The Zombie King will be accurately.
The foresight of Tirion is not perfect and the present unfolds itself to be slightly different from what Tirion expects.
Somehow these small errors in Tirion's predictions are enough for The Zombie King to get away time and time again before Moko can confront him.

But then Tirion comes up with an ingenious plan to finally capture the villain.
By visting certain locations and looking for signs at these places Tirion is certain he can deduct where The Zombie King will be,
based on where The Zombie King was when those signs occured in the past.
So instead of making an imperfect prediction of where The Zombie King will be directly,
Tirion will make a much more reliable inference of where the Zombie King will be based on the environment.
A small group will accompany Moko on his quest consisting of Tirion, Sorsen and Burte, a woman who's super powers make her the strongest and fastest,
in the world, but who's intelligence leaves a lot to desire.

The places that Tirion needs to visit to look for signs, turn out to be a lot more dangerous than Tirion let on.
They involve encounters with:
* Hordes of Zombies
* Confronting a notorious crime family
* Visiting a dragon's lair
After many close encounters with death Tirion sees all the signs he needs to predict the time and location where The Zombie King should be.
Unfortunetaly when they arrive at the right place at the right time The Zombie King is nowhere in sight.
Moko gets increasingly desparate. When is he going to fulfill his destiny?

Disillusioned the group set out to find The Zombie King returns home, but on their way they get ambushed by Zombies.
They have a hard time defending themselves as Burte falls unconscious.
Without their strongest fighter the group seems to become overwhelmed.
When Moko gets cornered against numbers he can't possibly defeat a mysterious man interposes himself between Moko and the Zombies.
Moko can only watch flabbergasted how enraged Zombies throw themselves at the mysterious man,
who not only paries all attacks, but shatters the Zombies to dust as counter attacks hit home.
Soon the Zombie's rage turns to fear and they make a run for it.
When Moko wants to thank the stranger, who introduced himself as Xite, Sorsen yells to Moko to kill the man, because he is The Zombie King.
Upon hearing this the man flees and Moko persuits, but only half heartedly and The Zombie King soon disappears into the jungle.

In a desperate attempt to recapture The Zombie King, Tirion urges his father to climb the mountain that is said to lead to the edge of the world.
Only from a very high vantage point can Sorsen call upon his super powers to "know everything that was",
and help Tirion to outsmart The Zombie King.
A mountain range lies around the world as the characters now it.
The world at the other side gets veiled by mist most of the time and people that descended along the mountain walls never return.
It is therefor rumoured that no world exists beyond that mountain range.
When the group reaches the rim of the mountain a terrible tragedy takes place.

As Sorsen is calling upon Atad to tell him everything that happened, he's actually at a higher vantage point than The Tower, where he normally convokes his powers.
Therefor he receives much more knowledge than usual, even about places beyond the valley our heroes live in.
Sorsen is entirely overwelmed by this knowledge.
He still manages to transfer his knowledge to Tirion, but he dies soon after.
Tirion is devastated by his loss and the heroes abandon their quest to kill the Zombie King, who may have saved their lives.


Interlude I
-----------

Apart from being torn by the loss of his father all the new knowledge from outside the valley is very confusing to Tirion.
Apparently outside of the world that he knows there are much more people and places, with weird alien habits that don't make sense.
He deeply fears this new world and he starts to see it as the biggest threat to everybody he loves.
The valley should get protected by any means necessary and in the next part Tirion sets out to do this,
unaware that invertedly he destroys the society he holds so dear.
From his father's legacy he knows that the prophecies around Moko are a farce.
Moko is not The One and "The Zombie King" does not command the savages to destroy the world.
They are in fact agents from the outside world send to The Valley to break the power that Queen Sinia holds.
The disparity between what Moko is and the prophecies that Tirion believed in for so long baffle him
and he will not understand the nature of the prophecies until part III.
The origin of the prophecies are not the most important thing to Tirion at the moment.
He wants to defend himself against the outsiders and for that he needs an army.
Since the Zombies are without a ruler Tirion is certain that with his powers of foresight he can become their ruler.
As soon as he is ready Tirion plans to kill his former friend Moko and start the war with the outsiders.

Tirion looses all interest in Xite, who is better known as The Zombie King.
As far as Tirion he can tell, Xite is not a king at all, but merely another agent from the outside.
However his sister Tera now sees an opportunity to get together with Xite.
She has been secretly in love with Xite for years now.
The conditions under which Tera met Xite only become apparent in part III,
but for now it suffices to say that he made a wonderful impression on her,
which only grew stronger as Tira's fantasy idealized the man she was not allowed to see by her mother Queen Sinia.
Tera knows that the only way people can find Xite is when they search him without the intent of violence.
She would love to find him and talk to him, but it is much too dangerous to go out into The Wilds alone.
Tera now sees an opportunity to find Xite together with Moko.
Since Moko is not set out to try to kill Xite on sight and will be willing to talk,
as he starts to doubt the prophecy proclaiming he'll kill the man who saved his life.
It will still be dangerous for them to search Xite, but Tera's love for him is driving her to take the risk.


Part II: Rally of the Zombie Hordes
-----------------------------------

Tirion orders Burte to kill our hero Moko.



Interlude 2
-----------

It's left somewhat in the middle what happens after Tirion gives the order.
What is unknown to the reader is that Moko indeed dies, but that another Moko exists in a parallel world.

This parallel world stems from Tera and Sinia, the mother and sister of Tirion, who have a super power together.
Tera's power is to make paintings that depict the world as she wants them to be.
Once finished Sinia can approve a painting.
At that point anybody can step through this painting into the alternative world that Tera depicted.

Tera and Sinia often quarrel about the reality they want to live in.
The former is a dreamer that wants to radically change things, while the latter only wants minor adjustments.
Some of which her reluctant daughter is unwilling to draw for her.
However in this case they both want Tirion to be happy, unaware of the knowledge that brought him to fear and violence.
Tera made this painting and Sinia approved it.
They stepped through the painting and into the world where part III is taking place.
In this world Moko is very much alive and it is this Moko we continue to follow in the story.


Part III: The Acension
----------------------

Moko is living a similar life as he was in part 1. Still hunting The Zombie King with Tirion.
Both are unaware of the events that took place.

However a tragical accident happens. Moko falls into the pit that is on the top of the Tower.
This pit is thought to be endless and is a resting place for those that died.
He falls and falls, through the entire tower and he, he survives, because he falls into a water pool.
It turns out that beneath the tower is a secret cave with an underground lake.

In the pitch black dark Moko finds his way out of the water and discovers by touch some kind of fabric that you can easily stick your hand through.
Uncertain whether he should go through it he's startled by a sudden splash. Somebody fell into the lake.
It's Burte who turns on a lamp hanging from the ceiling.
Then Moko realises the fabric he could so easily penatrate is actually a painting Tirion depicted in dispare, standing over Moko's corpse,
with in the background a window where the city is burning.
As the painting is signed it's clear that Tera made it.

Moko starts questioning Burte about what this place is, how come this is not the beginning and end of all things and what's happened to Tera's painting.
Burte evades his questions, by answering she's not allowed to answer questions to anyone about this place,
but not being very bright she answers the question: "who has told you to keep secret, the person who told you to keep this place secret?"
That turns out to be Sinia. Mother of Tirion and Tera.

Moko confronts Sinia with the secret place demanding to know more.
Sinia seems reluctant to tell the truth and in her role of Mother of the City,
she advices him to turn away from this for his own happiness and to never tell a soul.
He does so reluctantly and it's hard not to tell anything about this to his wife.
His wife however feels that something is wrong and starts pressing Moko.
They get into an argument from which he flees.
He goes to Tera to ask about the painting and what it means.
Hoping to learn more about the mysterious cave under the tower.

When Moko starts asking about the painting in a bit of a casual manor, without mentioning the cave directly Tera is immediatelly on edge.
She tells him his life is in danger and that they need to get out of here right away.
Indeed not long thereafter assassins enter Tera's house trying to kill Moko,
but thanks to Tera who the assassins seem to spare at all costs Moko defeats the assassins during a chaise around the city.

When they're catching their breath from the homocide attempt Tera explains he's got to come with her.
It's the only way to make things right. Sinia is behind the attack and she wont rest until Moko is dead.
When Moko asks what they're going to do Tera simply says he won't believe her until he sees it for himself.
She promises to explain everything, but now they have no time to loose.

Tera and Moko climb the tower and Moko almost looses his life again this time at the hand of Tirion who seems convinced Moko is a traitor.
Moko desparately tries to tell Tirion that he's mistaken, while fighting an adversary who knows his every move before he makes it.
To escape Tirion, Tera and Moko pretend to fall into the hole.
Believing they have returned to the source and have died Tirion does not pursuit.
Once in the secret cave and outside the water Tera beckons Moko to follow her through the painting.
As Moko steps through the painting he's unaware that he enters a world that is in more turmoil than the one he's leaving.

It takes Moko and Tera a lot of effort to climb out of The Tower and leave the place without being seen.
Once in a safe place Tera explains to Moko that it was Sinia who convinced Tirion that Moko was a traitor.
Her power is to be right even when she's wrong.
Furthermore Tera explains her own power is to create alternative worlds
and that they're currently in a world that Sinia wants to abandon.
Moko is more than a little desperate and has no idea what to do next.
Tera tells him that her aunt Tachm might be able to help him.
She's a prophet like Tirion, but instead of telling the immediate future,
she can tell which course in life would make him happiest.

However there's a catch. Tera wants Moko to help her find her lover The Zombie King.
Tirion is keeping The Zombie King captured and together they set out to free him.

Moko learns that he's dead in this world and that Tirion has thrown the world into chaos.
It also becomes clear that Tirion has abandoned the Tower and has moved towards the truly highest point in The Valley,
where his father acquired so much knowledge that it killed him.
Up in his stronghold he has secluded himself from society.
Burte has wracked havoc in Terniten and instead of normal travel between places in people now have to use paths paved by stone.
There is one such path that climbs the Valley's ridge all the way up to the stronghold where Tirion lives.
Tera and Moko quickly abandon this road, because they don't want Tirion to know that they're coming.
The element of surprise is their biggest advantage.

After some ordeals they to find The Zombie King in Tirion's stronghold.
To free him they have to face Tirion who seems to haven't gone insane,
but is only trying everything in his power to make The Valley a better place, protecting it from the unknown evil outside.
Tirion does regret the murder of his friend, but as Moko was manipulated by Sinia he couldn't risk an attack from his friend.
He deeply apologizes, but assures Moko that freeing The Zombie King would be a big mistake.
Everything that has been build by Tirion to defend The Valley is due to The Zombie King.
Tirion explains that the power of the Zombie King is to set the monkeys to work.
If their enemies would get a hold on The Zombie King, they could harness the labor of the monkeys to build an army.
An army would easily overrun The Valley and destroy it.
Without Tera and Sinia to create an alternative world the Valley would fall for real this time.
Everybody Moko loves would die a horrible death.

Moko is uncertain what to do, but he can't risk killing Tirion or freeing The Zombie King.
Instead he demands to know where Tachm is to learn about his true destiny.
