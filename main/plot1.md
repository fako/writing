Plot Part 1: Hunt for the Monkey King
=====================================

An overview of important events in part one the main story.


Introduction: Climbing the Tower
--------------------------------

We follow Sersen. An old man who dutyfully climbs a large tower despite his age.
As he does so he reflects upon the world. Giving some insight to the world the story is set in.

At the top of the tower Sersen reflects on a deep dark whole in the roof of the tower.
This whole is thought to be endless and the origin of all life.
Then Sersen turns towards the view from the tower and calls upon a mysterious power he calls Atad.
A black mist rises up from the ground and speeds towards Sersen.
The black mist enters his brain so violently that he passes out.

When Sersen awakes his son Tirdecpion sits next to him and when he embraces him some of the power flows from father to son.
At that point Tirdecpion realizes something horrible is about to happen.
 

Plunder at The Market
---------------------

Cerof is at The Market in the City of Terniten after a lead from his friend the prophet Tirdecpion.
He foretells that a violent plunder will occur at The Market today.
Unfortunatelly his friend is rarely wrong in these matters and Cerof is there to stop any violence.
This time Cerof hopes to be able to capture The Monkey King.
The man who is thought to be behind the numberous attacks upon the city.

From the wildernis that borders the market the feared attack commences.
The city is saved from the barbarians this time due to the all seeing Tirdecpion, valliant Cerof and incredible Burte
(who is so strong she stops a spear by holding it between two fingers).
And this time their apparent leader gets captured, when Cerof sees him he immediately knows he's not The Monkey King.
However he plans to take revenge rather than bring this man to justice.


Travelling Terniten
-------------------

Terniten is a miraculous city. Instead of roads there are portals that can hop its citizens from place to place.
Not every place has a portal to every other place. So there's a few jumps to commence before the group will arrive at The Tower.
When Cerof gets a chance he takes the prisoner through another portal than the rest of the party.
He starts interogating the prisoner, because he suspects that he was involved with the death of his little brother.
When the prisoner only exclaims outrageous lies he looses control and starts beating the helpless man to get to the truth.
Cerof only stops when his crew catches up with them.


A Chance to Catch the Monkey King
---------------------------------

Cerof is embarresed for his behaviour. How could he let his emotions go like that?  
He joins his friend Tirdecpion who is surrounded by small animals when he approaches.
As always Cerof scares the creatures away. He doesn't have the same knack for animals as Tirdecpion.

However Tirdecpion has a plan.
The Monkey King has always been a step ahead of Tirdecpion. He has been unable to correctly anticipate the moves of the villain for years.
Small animals are easy to predict. They behave the same in similar circumstances and their possible reactions are limited.
The Monkey King is the exact opposite. He's irredicate.
He never seems to do what Tirdecpion would expect based on how The Monkey King acted before.
It seems that he always does something new, but it only seems that way.
Tirdecpion now discovered that there is a pattern to The Monkey King's movements.
That pattern is based on what happens inside the most criminal part of the city.
Tirdecpion wants to go there and when he sees with his own eyes how the criminals are behaving.
Then he'll be able to see where The Monkey King will be, as clear as he sees what small animals will do.
That would be a unique opportinity to finally catch the most wanted man in Terniten.

Cerof thinks that Tirdecpion most be loosing his mind.
He has faith in the clairvoyance of his friend, but how can they ever go to the dark part of Terniten and live to tell the tale?
That's when Tirdecpion reveils grave news. He foresees that the criminal who might have murdered Cerof's little brother is going to be laid off.
The judge will rule that the violence by Cerof was out of proportian and an exemption is in order.
However if Cerof offers the man a deal before his case goes to trial and offers his freedom in exchange for free passage in the dark part of Terniten.
Then he's likely to take it.
Cerof becomes furious at this suggestion. Releasing the murderer of his little brother?
It doesn't take Cerof long to realise that he has been played.
Terdicpion had seen that Cerof would not be able to control himself when confronted with the murderer.
So he knew that Cerof would take revenge and he knew that Cerof's actions would send the criminal free. 
But instead of warning Cerof, Tirdecpion has said nothing so that Terdicpion would be able to execute his plan to capture The Monkey King.
Cerof furiously storms out of the garden.


A Murderer Set Free
-------------------

Cerof sits at the top of the Tower and looks into the black pit that sits in the middle of the roof.
The pit is thought to be the source of all life and when somebody dies,
it is custom to return this person to the source.
Hence this is the resting place of Cerof's little brother.

Cetisuj the wife of Cerof joins Cerof on the roof. She tries to talk to him, but Cerof is bitter and doesn't want to.
Cetisuj is one of the wise who judges criminals and it is her that's going to let the murderer of Cerof's brother go,
because Cerof could not control himself.
Cerof tries to convince her to do otherwise, and even though Cetisuj clearly loves Cerof, she will not budge.
It is then that Cerof decides to go with the plan of Tirdecpion to at least make all the trouble worthwhile.
