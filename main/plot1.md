Plot (WIP)
==========

An overview of turning points in the main story.
This plot is still a work in progress and I'm currently focusing more on the overarching story than the details of plot 1.


Nitra Knows Where The Monkey King Will Be
-----------------------------------------

The Monkey King was always able to elude authorities.
Until one day when The All Knowing feeds Nitra with knowledge that The Monkey King will be at a certain place and time.  
This seems the perfect opportunity to get rid of The Monkey King once and for all.

What exactly feeds the hate for The Monkey King?


The House Of Wal Objects To Killing The Monkey King
---------------------------------------------------

When The House of Wal discovers the plan to kill The Monkey King they convince everybody to capture him alive.


The Adventurers Go On The Quest To Capture The Monkey King
----------------------------------------------------------

A group of adventures is going to the place where The Monkey King is going to be in the near future in order to capture him. 
That place is somewhere in The Jungle.

The characters that are going are:
* Tirdecpion, the leader
* The All Knowing, the only person who knows exactly where they need to go
* Burte, coming along to protect against the dangers of The Jungle
* Xael, the only one who knows how to survive in The Jungle
* Cerof, there to make sure the The Monkey King gets captured and not killed
