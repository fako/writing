Plot
====

An outline of the story of the trilogy. Between the three parts there are interludes.
What happens between these interludes is only known to the reader by what is told about them in the main parts of the trilogy.

Currently the story is far from finished. Only part 1 is somewhat finished.
The other parts are more in a sketch phase and need to be further developed. 


Hero: Cerof
-----------

The person we follow in this trilogy is Cerof. His dilemma is that of activism versus pacifism.
To (forcefully) act, change the world and risk doing more harm than good.
Or to (helplessly) wait, see the world change and risk the decay of the things you love.

During the story Cerof develops an understanding that it's impossible to tell right from wrong
and that such classifications depend on your point of view.
He learns that an open mind and heart will bring you fartest in life.


Part 1: Hunt for the Monkey King
--------------------------------

Everywhere The Monkey King goes he plunders, assaults and rapes the population.
Many men follow him into this destructive life, resulting in a savage mob of "monkeys" that terrorize everybody.

Cerof is the man responsible for stopping The Monkey King.
It's his duty to confront him, capture him alive and bring him to The Tower, where he shall receive judgement.

A big problem is that Cerof does not know where to find The Monkey King.
Whenever Cerof hears where he might be he goes there and finds nobody. Cerof has never even seen The Monkey King.
It's almost as if he doesn't exist, but the horrible stories coming from his victims tell otherwise.

Cerof gets help to find The Monkey King from his friend Tirdecpion and Sersen, who is Tirdecpion's father.
Sersen is an old man, but he regularly climbs The Tower to call upon his super powers. Which is to know everything that was.
Through the bond of love that he has with his son, Sersen transfers some of his knowledge to Tirdecpion, which awakens his super power to predict the future.
However since the foresight of Tirdecpion is not perfect the present unfolds itself to be slightly different from what Tirdecpion expects.
As time passes these differences become bigger and bigger, until he re-connects with the historic knowledge from his father.
So far Tirdecpion hasn't been able to pin point where The Monkey King will be accurately.

At the start of the story however Tirdecpion comes up with a plan to finally capture the villain.
By visting certain locations and looking for signs at these places Tirdecpion is certain he can deduct where The Monkey King will be,
based on where The Monkey was when those signs occured in the past.
Everybody thinks it is an ingenious plan and they gather a small group to accompany Cerof and Tirdecpion on their quest to bring The Monkey King to justice.

These places that Tirdecpion needs to visit to look for signs, turn out to be a lot more dangerous than Cerof signed up for.
After many close encounters with death they finally arrive where The Monkey King should be.
Unfortunetaly he's not and Cerof is more than a little angry for putting everybodies lives on the line for yet another failure.
Disillusioned they return home when they hear growls and soft screams from the bushes.
They approach carefully and see a man making love to a women in an intense way, which both seem to enjoy.
When Sersen catches up he sees immediatelly that the man is The Monkey King.

They capture The Monkey King and contemplate on executing him on the spot.
Although the hate for the villain runs deep they decide to bring him to The Tower for trial instead.

However The Monkey King escapes his captors. In a desperate attempt to recapture him Tirdecpion urges his father to climb the mountain to the edge of the world.
Only from a very high vantage point can Sersen call upon his super powers to "know everything that was", and help Tirdecpion to outsmart The Monkey King.
The only high point nearby is the mountain beyond which it is thought that nothing exists.
In truth there lies a deep valley beyond the mountain rim, which gets veiled by mist most of the time.
When they reach the top of the mountain a terrible tragedy takes place.

When Sersen is using his super powers he's actually at a higher vantage point than The Tower.
Therefor he receives much more knowledge than usual.
Even about places beyond the valley our hero's live in and Sersen didn't even know existed. He's entirely overwelmed by this knowledge.
He still manages to transfer his knowledge to Tirdecpion, but he dies soon after.

Apart from being torn by the loss of his father all the new knowledge is very confusing to Tirdecpion.
Outside of the world that he knows there are apparently much more people and places, with weird alien habits that don't make sense.
He deeply fears this new world and he starts to see it as the biggest threat to everybody he loves.
Tirdecpion also holds these outsiders responsible for the death of his father.

However to Cerof (and the reader) what happens to Tirdecpion is not immediatelly clear, because Tirdecpion is not sharing about his new terrifying insights that he can barely grasp himself.
Therefor to Cerof Tirdecpion seems to have simply lost his mind.
He laughs manically, seems nervous and he starts to destroy parts of the City of Terniten for no apparent reason,
assisted by his girlfriend Burte, who's super strong, super fast, but also super stupid and easily manipulated by Tirdecpion.

As Cerof is trying to stop his former friend Tirdecpion by pleading him to stop the madness. Tirdecpion orders Burte to kill our hero Cerof.
This is where part 1 ends.


Interlude 1
-----------

It's left somewhat in the middle what happens after Tirdecpion gives the order.
What is unknown to the reader is that Cerof indeed dies, but that another Cerof exists in a parallel world.

This parallel world stems from Regne, the sister of Tirdecpion, who also has a super power.
Her power is to make paintings that depict the world as she wants them to be.
Once finished she can step through these paintings and live in the alternative world she just created.
However she can only make minor changes to the world, as she has to paint some detail that she wants to change, and is unable to capture the entire world in one painting.

Regne and Tirdecpion's mother knows about Regne's power and asks her to paint Tirdecpion as happy, unaware of the knowledge that brought him to fear and violence.
Together Regne and the mother stepped through the painting and into the world where part 2 is taking place.
In this world Cerof is very much alive and it is this Cerof we continue to follow in the story.


Part 2: A Whole New World
-------------------------

Cerof is living a similar life as he was in part 1. Still hunting The Monkey King with Tirdecpion.
Both are unaware of the events that took place.

However a tragical accedent happens. Cerof falls into the pit that is on the top of the Tower.
This pit is thought to be endless and is a resting place for those that died.
He falls and falls, through the entire tower and he, he survives, because he falls into a water pool.
It turns out that beneath the tower is a secret room.

There he sees a painting of Tirdecpion depicted in dispear, standing over his own corpse,
with in the background a window where the city is burning.

Cerof discovers that if he touches the painting it turns into somekind of mirror, showing the room behind him, but not his own reflection.
He steps through the painting unaware that he enters a world that is in turmoil.
Cerof learns that he's dead and that Tirdecpion has thrown the world into chaos and has since secluded himself from society.
He sets out to find Tirdecpion and he starts talking to him to find out what is going on.

It turns out that the world is a lot bigger than Cerof has ever imagined it to be and that Tirdecpion seems to haven't gone insane,
but is only trying everything in his power to make The Valley a better place, protecting it from the unknown evil outside.
Tirdecpion does regret the murder of his friend and wants to redeem himself.

It has become clear that Regne and the mother of Tirdecpion have disappeared from the world Cerof and Tirdecpion are on and they plan to confront Tirdecpion's mother with the
truth she must know, but has kept a secret. They step back through the painting to confront her.


Interlude 2
-----------

Tirdecpion's mother did not take the accusations litely. She decided to capture the heroes and asks Regne to create a new painting dipicting a Tirdecpion,
that doesn't know anything about the manipulation she needs for a happy family.

In order to justify the lock up of Cerof and Tirdecpion she tells false stories about them to everybody. Knowing that these lies will not endure forever;
she steps through the painting with her daughter and then attempts to destroy the painting to forever seal the gate between the two worlds.
However the destruction of the portal also destroys the reality that lies behind it. Meaning that Cerof's world is starting to collapse.


Part 3: The Valley
------------------

This parts starts with Cerof and Tirdecpion in prison and a terrible shimmer that goes through The Valley.
These earthquakes have been happening for a while and with their rising intensity are starting to do real damage.

Cerof and Tirdecpion manage to escape through the weakened structure of their prison and have to race against the clock to prevent the destruction of the painting
and with it their world.
