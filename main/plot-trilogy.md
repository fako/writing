Plot
====

An outline of the story of the trilogy. Between the three parts there are interludes.
What happens between these interludes is only known to the reader by what is told about them in the main parts of the trilogy.

Currently the story is maybe half way.
The first two parts are somewhat finished, but are expected to change as the third part takes shape.
The heros journey will need to get updated as well as it's not quite there yet.


Hero: Moko
-----------

The person we follow in this trilogy is Moko. His dilemma is that of activism versus pacifism.
To (forcefully) act, change the world and risk doing more harm than good.
Or to (helplessly) wait, see the world change and risk the decay of the things you love.

During the story Moko develops an understanding that it's impossible to tell right from wrong
and that such classifications depend on your point of view.
He learns that an open mind and heart will bring you fartest in life.


Part 1: Hunt for the Monkey King
--------------------------------

Everywhere The Monkey King goes he plunders, assaults and rapes the population.
Many men follow him into this destructive life, resulting in a savage mob of "monkeys" that terrorize everybody.

Moko is the man responsible for stopping The Monkey King.
It's his duty to confront him, capture him alive and bring him to The Tower, where he shall receive judgement.

A big problem is that Moko does not know where to find The Monkey King.
Whenever Moko hears where he might be he goes there and finds nobody. Moko has never even seen The Monkey King.
It's almost as if he doesn't exist, but the horrible stories coming from his victims tell otherwise.

Moko gets help to find The Monkey King from his friend Tirdecpion and Sersen, who is Tirdecpion's father.
Sersen is an old man, but he regularly climbs The Tower to call upon his super powers. Which is to know everything that was.
Through the bond of love that he has with his son, Sersen transfers some of his knowledge to Tirdecpion, which awakens his super power to predict the future.
However since the foresight of Tirdecpion is not perfect the present unfolds itself to be slightly different from what Tirdecpion expects.
As time passes these differences become bigger and bigger, until he re-connects with the historic knowledge from his father.
So far Tirdecpion hasn't been able to pin point where The Monkey King will be accurately.

At the start of the story however Tirdecpion comes up with a plan to finally capture the villain.
By visting certain locations and looking for signs at these places Tirdecpion is certain he can deduct where The Monkey King will be,
based on where The Monkey was when those signs occured in the past.
Everybody thinks it is an ingenious plan and they gather a small group to accompany Moko and Tirdecpion on their quest to bring The Monkey King to justice.

These places that Tirdecpion needs to visit to look for signs, turn out to be a lot more dangerous than Moko signed up for.
After many close encounters with death they finally arrive where The Monkey King should be.
Unfortunetaly he's not and Moko is more than a little angry for putting everybodies lives on the line for yet another failure.
Disillusioned they return home when they hear growls and soft screams from the bushes.
They approach carefully and see a man making love to a women in an intense way, which both seem to enjoy.
When Sersen catches up he sees immediatelly that the man is The Monkey King.

They capture The Monkey King and contemplate on executing him on the spot.
Although the hate for the villain runs deep they decide to bring him to The Tower for trial instead.

However The Monkey King escapes his captors. In a desperate attempt to recapture him Tirdecpion urges his father to climb the mountain to the edge of the world.
Only from a very high vantage point can Sersen call upon his super powers to "know everything that was", and help Tirdecpion to outsmart The Monkey King.
The only high point nearby is the mountain beyond which it is thought that nothing exists.
In truth there lies a deep valley beyond the mountain rim, which gets veiled by mist most of the time.
When they reach the top of the mountain a terrible tragedy takes place.

When Sersen is using his super powers he's actually at a higher vantage point than The Tower.
Therefor he receives much more knowledge than usual.
Even about places beyond the valley our hero's live in and Sersen didn't even know existed. He's entirely overwelmed by this knowledge.
He still manages to transfer his knowledge to Tirdecpion, but he dies soon after.

Apart from being torn by the loss of his father all the new knowledge is very confusing to Tirdecpion.
Outside of the world that he knows there are apparently much more people and places, with weird alien habits that don't make sense.
He deeply fears this new world and he starts to see it as the biggest threat to everybody he loves.
Tirdecpion also holds these outsiders responsible for the death of his father.

However to Moko (and the reader) what happens to Tirdecpion is not immediatelly clear, because Tirdecpion is not sharing about his new terrifying insights that he can barely grasp himself.
Therefor to Moko Tirdecpion seems to have simply lost his mind.
He laughs manically, seems nervous and he starts to destroy parts of the City of Terniten for no apparent reason,
assisted by his girlfriend Burte, who's super strong, super fast, but also super stupid and easily manipulated by Tirdecpion.

As Moko is trying to stop his former friend Tirdecpion by pleading him to stop the madness. Tirdecpion orders Burte to kill our hero Moko.
This is where part 1 ends.


Interlude 1
-----------

It's left somewhat in the middle what happens after Tirdecpion gives the order.
What is unknown to the reader is that Moko indeed dies, but that another Moko exists in a parallel world.

This parallel world stems from Regne and Cimsidirn, the mother and sister of Tirdecpion, who have a super power together.
Regne's power is to make paintings that depict the world as she wants them to be.
Once finished Cimsidirn can approve a painting.
At that point anybody can step through this painting into the alternative world that Regne depicted.

Regne and Cimsidirn often quarrel about the reality they want to live in.
The former is a dreamer that wants to radically change things, while the latter only wants minor adjustments.
Some of which her reluctant daughter is unwilling to draw for her.
However in this case they both want Tirdecpion to be happy, unaware of the knowledge that brought him to fear and violence.
Regne made this painting and Cimsidirn approved it.
They stepped through the painting and into the world where part 2 is taking place.
In this world Moko is very much alive and it is this Moko we continue to follow in the story.


Part 2: A Whole New World
-------------------------

Moko is living a similar life as he was in part 1. Still hunting The Monkey King with Tirdecpion.
Both are unaware of the events that took place.

However a tragical accident happens. Moko falls into the pit that is on the top of the Tower.
This pit is thought to be endless and is a resting place for those that died.
He falls and falls, through the entire tower and he, he survives, because he falls into a water pool.
It turns out that beneath the tower is a secret cave with an underground lake.

In the pitch black dark Moko finds his way out of the water and discovers by touch some kind of fabric that you can easily stick your hand through.
Uncertain whether he should go through it he's startled by a sudden splash. Somebody fell into the lake.
It's Burte who turns on a lamp hanging from the ceiling.
Then Moko realises the fabric he could so easily penatrate is actually a painting Tirdecpion depicted in dispare, standing over Moko's corpse,
with in the background a window where the city is burning.
As the painting is signed it's clear that Regne made it.

Moko starts questioning Burte about what this place is, how come this is not the beginning and end of all things and what's happened to Regne's painting.
Burte evades his questions, by answering she's not allowed to answer questions to anyone about this place,
but not being very bright she answers the question: "who has told you to keep secret, the person who told you to keep this place secret?"
That turns out to be Cimsidirn. Mother of Tirdecpion and Regne.

Moko confronts Cimsidirn with the secret place demanding to know more.
Cimsidirn seems reluctant to tell the truth and in her role of Mother of the City,
she advices him to turn away from this for his own happiness and to never tell a soul.
He does so reluctantly and it's hard not to tell anything about this to his wife.
His wife however feels that something is wrong and starts pressing Moko.
They get into an argument from which he flees.
He goes to Regne to ask about the painting and what it means.
Hoping to learn more about the mysterious cave under the tower.

When Moko starts asking about the painting in a bit of a casual manor, without mentioning the cave directly Regne is immediatelly on edge.
She tells him his life is in danger and that they need to get out of here right away.
Indeed not long thereafter assassins enter Regne's house trying to kill Moko,
but thanks to Regne who the assassins seem to spare at all costs Moko defeats the assassins during a chaise around the city.

When they're catching their breath from the homocide attempt Regne explains he's got to come with her.
It's the only way to make things right. Cimsidirn is behind the attack and she wont rest until Moko is dead.
When Moko asks what they're going to do Regne simply says he won't believe her until he sees it for himself.
She promises to explain everything, but now they have no time to loose.

Regne and Moko climb the tower and Moko almost looses his life again this time at the hand of Tirdecpion who seems convinced Moko is a traitor.
Moko desparately tries to tell Tirdecpion that he's mistaken, while fighting an adversary who knows his every move before he makes it.
To escape Tirdecpion, Regne and Moko pretend to fall into the hole.
Believing they have returned to the source and have died Tirdecpion does not pursuit.
Once in the secret cave and outside the water Regne beckons Moko to follow her through the painting.
As Moko steps through the painting he's unaware that he enters a world that is in more turmoil than the one he's leaving.

It takes Moko and Regne a lot of effort to climb out of The Tower and leave the place without being seen.
Once in a safe place Regne explains to Moko that it was Cimsidirn who convinced Tirdecpion that Moko was a traitor.
Her power is to be right even when she's wrong.
Furthermore Regne explains her own power is to create alternative worlds
and that they're currently in a world that Cimsidirn wants to abandon.
Moko is more than a little desperate and has no idea what to do next.
Regne tells him that her aunt Tachm might be able to help him.
She's a prophet like Tirdecpion, but instead of telling the immediate future,
she can tell which course in life would make him happiest.

However there's a catch. Regne wants Moko to help her find her lover The Monkey King.
Tirdecpion is keeping The Monkey King captured and together they set out to free him.

Moko learns that he's dead in this world and that Tirdecpion has thrown the world into chaos.
It also becomes clear that Tirdecpion has abandoned the Tower and has moved towards the truly highest point in The Valley,
where his father acquired so much knowledge that it killed him.
Up in his stronghold he has secluded himself from society.
Burte has wracked havoc in Terniten and instead of normal travel between places in people now have to use paths paved by stone.
There is one such path that climbs the Valley's ridge all the way up to the stronghold where Tirdecpion lives.
Regne and Moko quickly abandon this road, because they don't want Tirdecpion to know that they're coming.
The element of surprise is their biggest advantage.

After some ordeals they to find The Monkey King in Tirdecpion's stronghold.
To free him they have to face Tirdecpion who seems to haven't gone insane,
but is only trying everything in his power to make The Valley a better place, protecting it from the unknown evil outside.
Tirdecpion does regret the murder of his friend, but as Moko was manipulated by Cimsidirn he couldn't risk an attack from his friend.
He deeply apologizes, but assures Moko that freeing The Monkey King would be a big mistake.
Everything that has been build by Tirdecpion to defend The Valley is due to The Monkey King.
Tirdecpion explains that the power of the Monkey King is to set the monkeys to work.
If their enemies would get a hold on The Monkey King, they could harness the labor of the monkeys to build an army.
An army would easily overrun The Valley and destroy it.
Without Regne and Cimsidirn to create an alternative world the Valley would fall for real this time.
Everybody Moko loves would die a horrible death.

Moko is uncertain what to do, but he can't risk killing Tirdecpion or freeing The Monkey King.
Instead he demands to know where Tachm is to learn about his true destiny.
