Plot
====

An outline of the story of the trilogy. Between the three parts there are interludes.
What happens between these interludes is only known to the reader by what is told about them in the main parts of the trilogy.
Currently the story is not finished.
For each part there are as of yet vague sections that need clarification.


Part 1: Hunt for the Monkey King
--------------------------------

The Monkey King is a threat to the existance of the World and a man feared in the City of Terniten.
Only one man is brave enough to defy this evil, our hero Tirdecpion.

At the start of the story Tirdecpion is able to figure out the plans of the Monkey King after years of failure, with the help of his father Atad "The All Knowing". 
Atad is an old man, but he regularly climbs a huge tower to call upon his super powers. Which is to know everything that was.
Through the bond of love that he has with his son, Atad transfers some of his knowledge to Tirdecpion, which awakens his super intelligence.
Through this super intelligence Tirdecpion is able to know where the Monkey King will be in one month.

An expedition is launched into the jungle to find The Monkey King and bring him to justice.
When the heroes find the Monkey King, exactly where Tirdecpion told them he would be, Tirdecpion is about to kill him, but he's stopped by Cerof, an old friend of Tirdecpion,
who convinces Tirdecpion a fair trial should be given.

However The Monkey King escapes his captors. In a desperate attempt to recapture him Tirdecpion urges his father to climb the mountain. 
Only from a very high ventage point can Atad call upon his super powers to "know everything that was", and help Tirdecpion to outsmart The Monkey King.
The hope is that the heroes will still be able to defeat the horrible evil.
When they reach the top of the mountain however, a terrible tragedy takes place.

***************

When Atad is using his super powers he's overwelmed by it.
He still manages to transfer his knowledge to Tirdecpion, but he dies soon after.
From the loss of his father and the fact that the knowledge is so overwhelming Tirdecpion goes insane.
Tirdecpion returns to the City of Terniten, but when he does he throws the city into chaos, assisted by his girlfriend Burte, who's super strong, super fast and super stupid.
She's unsure about the decisions her boyfriend is making, but she trusts him and simply does what he says with catastrophic consequences.


Interlude 1
-----------

Unknown to Tirdecpion and the readers Regne, the sister of Tirdecpion, also has a super power.
Her power is to make paintings that depict the world as she wants them to be.
Once finished she can step through these paintings and live in the world she just created.
However she can only make minor changes to the world, as she has to paint some detail that she wants to change, and is unable to capture the entire world in one painting. 

Regne and Tirdecpion's mother knows about Regne's power and asks her to paint Tirdecpion as happy, unaware of the knowledge that brought him to insanity. 
Together Regne and the mother stepped through the painting and into the world where part 2 is taking place.


Part 2: A Whole New World
-------------------------

Tirdecpion is living a similar life as he was in part 1. Unaware of the events that took place.
He's still hunting the evil Monkey King with the help of his father.
However by accident he discovers a secret room in the palace at the center of the city where he sees a painting of him depicted in dispear, standing over his father's corpse,
with in the background a window where the city is burning.

To be clarified
***************

Tirdecpion discovers that if he touches the painting it turns into somekind of mirror, showing the room behind him, but not his own reflection.
He steps through the painting unaware that he enters a world where everything is in chaos. 
Tirdecpion learns that someone like him has thrown the world into chaos and has since secluded himself from society.
He sets out to find this person and when he discovers it is in fact him he starts talking to himself to find out what is going on.

It turns out that the world is a lot bigger than Tirdecpion has ever imagined it to be and that he seems to haven't gone insane,
but is only trying everything in his power to make The Valley a better place, protecting it from the outside while also allowing the outside in.
While searching for answers and the certainties he has known before the revelation of The World.

It has become clear that Regne and the mother of Tirdecpion have disappeared from the world both Tirdecpion's are on and they plan to confront their mother with the
truth she must know, but has kept a secret. They step back through the painting to confront her.


Interlude 2
-----------

Their mother did not take the accusations litely. She decided to capture the heroes and asks Regne to create a new painting dipicting a Tirdecpion,
that doesn't know anything about the manipulation she needs for a happy family. 

In order to justify the lock up of the Tirdecpion's she tells false stories about them. Knowing that these lies will not endure forever;
she steps through the painting with her daughter and then attempts to destroy the painting to forever seal the gate between the two worlds.
However the destruction of the portal also destroys the reality that lies behind it. Meaning that Tirdecpion's world is starting to collapse. 


Part 3: The Valley
------------------

This parts starts with the Tirdecpion's in prison and a terrible shimmer that goes through The Valley.
These earthquakes have been happening for a while and with their rising intensity are starting to do real damage.

The Tirdecpion's manage to escape through the weakened structure of their prison and have to race against the clock to prevent the destruction of the painting
and with it their world.
