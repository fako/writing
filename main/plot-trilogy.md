The Acension Trilogy
====================

The person we follow in this trilogy is Moko.
He develops from being a vengeful short sighted individual into a wise thoughtful man,
who takes his role in society as judge with the utmost vigilance.

In part I Moko is convinced that he is "The One" and that he's destined to deliver the world from evil.
In part II he starts to realize that the role he has to play in this world is more elaborate than he initially thought.
In part III he fully realizes that, although the answers to many problems in the world can not be solved with destiny and violence,
he does have an important role to play as a sincere, thoughtful individual that fights for justice peacefully.

Between the three parts there are interludes.
What happens between these interludes is only known to the reader by what is told about them in the main parts of the trilogy.


Part 1: Hunt for the Savage King
--------------------------------

Everywhere The Savage King and his followers go they plunder, assault and rape the population.
Moko is The One who is destined to stop The Savage King and safe The Valley from the barbaric mob that terrorize everybody.
It is foretold that Moko will strike The Savage King down in an epic battle where everybody else has failed.
Amongst his peers Moko stands in high redeem and people can't wait to get rid of the evil that has haunt their lives for so long.

However at the start of the story Moko does not know where to find The Savage King.
Whenever Moko hears where he might be he goes there and finds nobody. Moko has never even seen The Savage King.
It's almost as if he doesn't exist, but the horrible stories coming from the victims of the barbaric pillaging tell otherwise.

Moko gets help to find The Savage King from his friend Tirion as well as Tirion's father Sorsen.
Sorsen is an old man, but he regularly climbs The Tower to call upon his super powers. Which is to know everything that was.
Through the bond of love that he has with his son, Sorsen transfers some of his knowledge to Tirion,
which awakens his super power to predict the future.
Father and son are a formidable team in the struggle against the savages, with their combined knowledge of past and future,
but so far Tirion hasn't been able to pin point where The Savage King will be accurately.
The foresight of Tirion is not perfect and the present unfolds itself to be slightly different from what Tirion expects.
Somehow these small errors in Tirion's predictions are enough for The Savage King to get away time and time again before Moko can confront him.

But then Tirion comes up with an ingenious plan to finally capture the villain.
By visting certain locations and looking for signs at these places Tirion is certain he can deduct where The Savage King will be,
based on where The Savage King was when those signs occured in the past.
So instead of making an imperfect prediction of where The Savage King will be directly,
Tirion will make a much more reliable inference of where the Savage King will be based on the environment.
A small group will accompany Moko on his quest consisting of Tirion, Sorsen and Burte, a woman who's super powers make her the strongest and fastest,
in the world, but who's intelligence leaves a lot to desire.

The places that Tirion needs to visit to look for signs, turn out to be a lot more dangerous than Tirion let on.
They involve encounters with:
* Hordes of Savages
* Confronting a notorious crime family
* Visiting a dragon's lair
After many close encounters with death Tirion sees all the signs he needs to predict the time and location where The Savage King should be.
Unfortunetaly when they arrive at the right place at the right time The Savage King is nowhere in sight.
Moko gets increasingly desparate. When is he going to fulfill his destiny?

Disillusioned the group set out to find The Savage King returns home, but on their way they get ambushed by Savages.
They have a hard time defending themselves as Burte falls unconscious.
Without their strongest fighter the group seems to become overwhelmed.
When Moko gets cornered against numbers he can't possibly defeat a mysterious man interposes himself between Moko and the Savages.
Moko can only watch flabbergasted how enraged Savages throw themselves at the mysterious man,
who not only paries all attacks, but shatters the Savages to dust as counter attacks hit home.
Soon the Savage's rage turns to fear and they make a run for it.
When Moko wants to thank the stranger Sorsen yells to Moko to kill the man, because he is The Savage King.
Upon hearing this the man flees and Moko persuits, but only half heartilly and The Savage King soon disappears into the jungle.

In a desperate attempt to recapture The Savage King, Tirion urges his father to climb the mountain that is said to lead to the edge of the world.
Only from a very high vantage point can Sorsen call upon his super powers to "know everything that was",
and help Tirion to outsmart The Savage King.
A mountain range lies around the world as the characters now it.
The world at the other side gets veiled by mist most of the time and people that descended along the mountain walls never return.
It is therefor rumoured that no world exists beyond that mountain range.
When the group reaches the rim of the mountain a terrible tragedy takes place.

As Sorsen is calling upon Atad to tell him everything that happened, he's actually at a higher vantage point than The Tower, where he normally convokes his powers.
Therefor he receives much more knowledge than usual, even about places beyond the valley our heroes live in.
Sorsen is entirely overwelmed by this knowledge.
He still manages to transfer his knowledge to Tirion, but he dies soon after.
Tirion is devastated by his loss and the heroes abandon their quest to kill the Savage King, who may have saved their lives.
