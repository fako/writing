Plot
====

An outline of the story of the trilogy. Between the three parts there are interludes.
What happens between these interludes is only known to the reader by what is told about them in the main parts of the trilogy.

Currently the story is maybe on two thirds.
The first and last part are taking shape, but the middle needs more work.


Hero: Moko
-----------

The person we follow in this trilogy is Moko.
He develops from being a vengeful short sighted individual into a wise thoughtful man,
who takes his role in society as judge with the utmost vigilance.

In part I Moko is convinced that he is "The One" and that he's destined to deliver the world from evil.
In part II he starts to realize that the role he has to play in this world is more elaborate than he initially thought.
In part III he fully realizes that, although the answers to many problems in the world can not be solved with destiny and violence,
he does have an important role to play as a sincere, thoughtful individual that fights for justice peacefully.


Part 1: Hunt for the Barbarian King
-----------------------------------

Everywhere The Barbarian King goes he plunders, assaults and rapes the population.
Many men follow him into this destructive life, resulting in a savage mob of barbarians that terrorize everybody.

Moko is The One who is destined to stop The Barbarian King and his horde of fellow criminals.
It is foretold that Moko will strike The Barbarian King down in an epic battle where everybody else has failed.
Amongst his peers Moko stands in high redeem and people can't wait to get rid of the evil that has haunt their lives for so long.

A big problem is that Moko does not know where to find The Barbarian King.
Whenever Moko hears where he might be he goes there and finds nobody. Moko has never even seen The Barbarian King.
It's almost as if he doesn't exist, but the horrible stories coming from the victims of the barbaric pillaging tell otherwise.

Moko gets help to find The Barbarian King from his friend Tirion and Sersen, who is Tirion's father.
Sersen is an old man, but he regularly climbs The Tower to call upon his super powers. Which is to know everything that was.
Through the bond of love that he has with his son, Sersen transfers some of his knowledge to Tirion,
which awakens his super power to predict the future.
However since the foresight of Tirion is not perfect the present unfolds itself to be slightly different from what Tirion expects.
As time passes these differences become bigger and bigger, until he re-connects with the historic knowledge from his father.
So far Tirion hasn't been able to pin point where The Barbarian King will be accurately.

At the start of the story however Tirion comes up with a plan to finally capture the villain.
By visting certain locations and looking for signs at these places Tirion is certain he can deduct where The Barbarian King will be,
based on where The Barbarion King was when those signs occured in the past.
Everybody thinks it is an ingenious plan and they gather a small group to accompany Moko and Tirion on their quest to bring The Barbarian King to justice.

These places that Tirion needs to visit to look for signs, turn out to be a lot more dangerous than Tirion let on.
They involve encounters with:
* Hordes of barbarians
* Confronting a notorious crime family
* Visiting a dragon's lair
After many close encounters with death Tirion sees all the signs he needs to predict the time and location where The Barbarian King should be.
and finally arrive where The Barbarian King should be.
Unfortunetaly when they arrive at the right place at the right time The Barbarian King is nowhere in sight.
Moko gets increasingly desparate. When is he going to fulfill his destiny?

Disillusioned the group set out to find The Barbarian King return home, but on their way they get ambushed by Barbarians.
They have a hard time defending themselves as Burte falls unconscious.
Without their strongest fighter the group seems to become overwhelmed.
When Moko gets cornered against numbers he can't possibly defeat a mysterious man interposes himself between Moko and the barbarians.
Moko can only watch flabbergasted how enraged barbarians throw themselves at the mysterious man, who not only paries all attacks, but shatters the barbarians to dust as counter attacks hit home.
Despite their losses the barbarians relentlessly attack their foe until all barbarians have turned to dust.
When Moko wants to thank the stranger Sorsen yells to Moko to kill the man, because he is The Barbarian King.
Upon hearing this the man flees and Moko persuits, but only half heartilly and The Barbarian King soon disappears into the jungle.

***doubt***
In a desperate attempt to recapture The Barbarian King, Tirion urges his father to climb the mountain to the edge of the world.
Only from a very high vantage point can Sorsen call upon his super powers to "know everything that was",
and help Tirion to outsmart The Barbarian King.
The only high point nearby is known as the edge of the world.
This mountain range lies around the world as the characters now it. Beyond it nothing exists according to their lore.
In truth their world is nothing but a valley that lies on the peak of a steep mountain.
The world below this mountain gets veiled by mist most of the time and people that descended along the mountain walls never returned.
When the group reaches the rim of the mountain a terrible tragedy takes place.

As Sorsen is calling upon Atad to tell him everything that happened, he's actually at a higher vantage point than The Tower, where he normally convokes his powers.
Therefor he receives much more knowledge than usual, even about places beyond the valley our heroes live in and Sorsen didn't know existed.
Sorsen is entirely overwelmed by this knowledge.
He still manages to transfer his knowledge to Tirion, but he dies soon after.

to be changed here
*********************


Apart from being torn by the loss of his father all the new knowledge is very confusing to Tirion.
Outside of the world that he knows there are apparently much more people and places, with weird alien habits that don't make sense.
He deeply fears this new world and he starts to see it as the biggest threat to everybody he loves.
Tirion also holds these outsiders responsible for the death of his father.

However to Moko (and the reader) what happens to Tirion is not immediatelly clear, because Tirion is not sharing about his new terrifying insights that he can barely grasp himself.
Therefor to Moko Tirion seems to have simply lost his mind.
He laughs manically, seems nervous and he starts to destroy parts of the City of Terniten for no apparent reason,
assisted by his girlfriend Burte, who's super strong, super fast, but also super stupid and easily manipulated by Tirion.

As Moko is trying to stop his former friend Tirion by pleading him to stop the madness. Tirion orders Burte to kill our hero Moko.
This is where part 1 ends.


Interlude 1

Part 2: A Whole New World
-------------------------




Interlude 2
-----------

It's left somewhat in the middle what happens after Tirion gives the order.
What is unknown to the reader is that Moko indeed dies, but that another Moko exists in a parallel world.

This parallel world stems from Tera and Sinia, the mother and sister of Tirion, who have a super power together.
Tera's power is to make paintings that depict the world as she wants them to be.
Once finished Sinia can approve a painting.
At that point anybody can step through this painting into the alternative world that Tera depicted.

Tera and Sinia often quarrel about the reality they want to live in.
The former is a dreamer that wants to radically change things, while the latter only wants minor adjustments.
Some of which her reluctant daughter is unwilling to draw for her.
However in this case they both want Tirion to be happy, unaware of the knowledge that brought him to fear and violence.
Tera made this painting and Sinia approved it.
They stepped through the painting and into the world where part 2 is taking place.
In this world Moko is very much alive and it is this Moko we continue to follow in the story.


Part 3: A Whole New World
-------------------------

Moko is living a similar life as he was in part 1. Still hunting The Barbarian King with Tirion.
Both are unaware of the events that took place.

However a tragical accident happens. Moko falls into the pit that is on the top of the Tower.
This pit is thought to be endless and is a resting place for those that died.
He falls and falls, through the entire tower and he, he survives, because he falls into a water pool.
It turns out that beneath the tower is a secret cave with an underground lake.

In the pitch black dark Moko finds his way out of the water and discovers by touch some kind of fabric that you can easily stick your hand through.
Uncertain whether he should go through it he's startled by a sudden splash. Somebody fell into the lake.
It's Burte who turns on a lamp hanging from the ceiling.
Then Moko realises the fabric he could so easily penatrate is actually a painting Tirion depicted in dispare, standing over Moko's corpse,
with in the background a window where the city is burning.
As the painting is signed it's clear that Tera made it.

Moko starts questioning Burte about what this place is, how come this is not the beginning and end of all things and what's happened to Tera's painting.
Burte evades his questions, by answering she's not allowed to answer questions to anyone about this place,
but not being very bright she answers the question: "who has told you to keep secret, the person who told you to keep this place secret?"
That turns out to be Sinia. Mother of Tirion and Tera.

Moko confronts Sinia with the secret place demanding to know more.
Sinia seems reluctant to tell the truth and in her role of Mother of the City,
she advices him to turn away from this for his own happiness and to never tell a soul.
He does so reluctantly and it's hard not to tell anything about this to his wife.
His wife however feels that something is wrong and starts pressing Moko.
They get into an argument from which he flees.
He goes to Tera to ask about the painting and what it means.
Hoping to learn more about the mysterious cave under the tower.

When Moko starts asking about the painting in a bit of a casual manor, without mentioning the cave directly Tera is immediatelly on edge.
She tells him his life is in danger and that they need to get out of here right away.
Indeed not long thereafter assassins enter Tera's house trying to kill Moko,
but thanks to Tera who the assassins seem to spare at all costs Moko defeats the assassins during a chaise around the city.

When they're catching their breath from the homocide attempt Tera explains he's got to come with her.
It's the only way to make things right. Sinia is behind the attack and she wont rest until Moko is dead.
When Moko asks what they're going to do Tera simply says he won't believe her until he sees it for himself.
She promises to explain everything, but now they have no time to loose.

Tera and Moko climb the tower and Moko almost looses his life again this time at the hand of Tirion who seems convinced Moko is a traitor.
Moko desparately tries to tell Tirion that he's mistaken, while fighting an adversary who knows his every move before he makes it.
To escape Tirion, Tera and Moko pretend to fall into the hole.
Believing they have returned to the source and have died Tirion does not pursuit.
Once in the secret cave and outside the water Tera beckons Moko to follow her through the painting.
As Moko steps through the painting he's unaware that he enters a world that is in more turmoil than the one he's leaving.

It takes Moko and Tera a lot of effort to climb out of The Tower and leave the place without being seen.
Once in a safe place Tera explains to Moko that it was Sinia who convinced Tirion that Moko was a traitor.
Her power is to be right even when she's wrong.
Furthermore Tera explains her own power is to create alternative worlds
and that they're currently in a world that Sinia wants to abandon.
Moko is more than a little desperate and has no idea what to do next.
Tera tells him that her aunt Tachm might be able to help him.
She's a prophet like Tirion, but instead of telling the immediate future,
she can tell which course in life would make him happiest.

However there's a catch. Tera wants Moko to help her find her lover The Barbarian King.
Tirion is keeping The Barbarian King captured and together they set out to free him.

Moko learns that he's dead in this world and that Tirion has thrown the world into chaos.
It also becomes clear that Tirion has abandoned the Tower and has moved towards the truly highest point in The Valley,
where his father acquired so much knowledge that it killed him.
Up in his stronghold he has secluded himself from society.
Burte has wracked havoc in Terniten and instead of normal travel between places in people now have to use paths paved by stone.
There is one such path that climbs the Valley's ridge all the way up to the stronghold where Tirion lives.
Tera and Moko quickly abandon this road, because they don't want Tirion to know that they're coming.
The element of surprise is their biggest advantage.

After some ordeals they to find The Barbarian King in Tirion's stronghold.
To free him they have to face Tirion who seems to haven't gone insane,
but is only trying everything in his power to make The Valley a better place, protecting it from the unknown evil outside.
Tirion does regret the murder of his friend, but as Moko was manipulated by Sinia he couldn't risk an attack from his friend.
He deeply apologizes, but assures Moko that freeing The Barbarian King would be a big mistake.
Everything that has been build by Tirion to defend The Valley is due to The Barbarian King.
Tirion explains that the power of the Barbarian King is to set the monkeys to work.
If their enemies would get a hold on The Barbarian King, they could harness the labor of the monkeys to build an army.
An army would easily overrun The Valley and destroy it.
Without Tera and Sinia to create an alternative world the Valley would fall for real this time.
Everybody Moko loves would die a horrible death.

Moko is uncertain what to do, but he can't risk killing Tirion or freeing The Barbarian King.
Instead he demands to know where Tachm is to learn about his true destiny.
