Version I
---------

Pragmatic freedom brings out the best in people
State of law brings out the best in society
Society needs a common reality to function
The power to dictate this common reality should not accumulate


Version II
----------

Many problems in the world can not be ignored or solved with our primal responses,
they require thoughtful individuals who can sincerely study the problem to come to a possible solution.
Dishonesty with ourselves and others stands in the way of this process
and keeps us from a truly happy life longer than is strictly necessary.
