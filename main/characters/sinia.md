Sinia (The Queen)
=================

Evil queen of The Valley. 
She rules by lying to her people, acting as if her policies benefit all, while in fact it mostly benefits her, her family and the rich.
The poor are often drawing the short end and suffer under Sinia's rule, without them realising she is causing their suffering.


Power
-----

Sinia's power is to know what is right and what is wrong.
In a way she looks into the future like Tirion, but instead of knowing what will happen she knows whether a choice will have a good or a bad outcome.
Sinia is seen as a benevolent ruler, who has brought prosperity and has guided many people to a happy fulfilling life.
However her dark side is that Sinia benefits most from the choices that Sinia makes herself and recommends to others.
