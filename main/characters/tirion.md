Tirion (The Seer)
=================

A man who deteriorates from a confident hero into an fearful tiran.


Storyline
---------

In the beginning Tirion sincerly wants to help [Moko (The One)](moko.md) at defeating [Xite (The Zombie King)](xite.md).
The prophecy that Moko is the one comes from him and he full heartly believes it.
In reality his mother [Sinia (The Queen)](sinia.md) tricked Tirion into seeing this prophecy and there is no merit to it.
The true goal of the prophecy is to get rid of Moko once and for all in order for Sinia to rule unchallenged and without boundaries.
If Moko would ever attack Xite he would surely die as he posseses the power to redirect any attack back to his attacker.
Xite has limited control over this power.
So even though Xite would never want to harm Moko, he would do so by accident if Moko ever voluntarily attacks, because he thinks he's destined for it.
However Xite learned about the ruse from The Queen through the princes [Tera (The Artist)](tera.md), who is in love with him.
To protect Moko, Xite fled the city and Tirion and Moko have been chasing him ever since.
It turns out to be very hard to find Xite, partly because he doesn't want to be found and partly because Tera keeps helping him.

So Moko and Tirion are struggeling to fulfill their (supposed) purpose, 
but at the beginning of part I, Tirion has a masterplan to find and kill Xite once and for all.
They set out to execute the plan, but instead of succeeding Tirion's father dies in the effort.
Tirion also accidently discovers that the prophecy is fake and that his mother Sinia (The Queen) is behind it all.
On top of that Tirion looses his power to foresee the future, because it stems from his father talking to the God Atad.

Desillusioned and devasted by the loss of his father as well as his powers, Tirion wants to take his suffering out on somebody and chooses his mother. 
She seems to be the source of his misery as she knew the mission that caused his father (and her husband's) death was a hoax.
Nonetheless she did nothing to keep his father from danger, and adding hurt to injury, 
she is even happy about being freed from her marriage, as it allows the relation with her lover to become more public.
At the end of part II Tirion betrays [Moko (The One)](moko.md) by killing him and takes over the rule from [Sinia (The Queen)](sinia.md). 
However he doesn't realize that Sinia together with his sister Tera is fleeing to an alternate dimension, created by Tera and Sinia,
where Moko as well as his father are still alive.
In that world lives another Tirion who is blessed with ignorance about his mother's plans.
