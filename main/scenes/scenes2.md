Scenes Part II
==============

An overview of important events in part two of the main story. More details about people, places and things in [the setting](../setting/index.md).
Listed events are not yet in chronological order and may still get dropped as the story develops.


Nature of the Zombies
---------------------

Moko and Tira have a discussion about the nature of the Zombies.
Moko fears the violent nature of the Zombies and is surprised that they aren't under regular attack.
Tira argues that people from The City often only get to know a small group from The Zombies.
Namely those that are enraged by the inequality between The Wild and The City and who can't help but express that anger towards The City's inhabitants.
That doesn't mean that most Zombies live violently, it is quite the opposite.
Most Zombies live peacefully and even if Moko and Tira were to expose where they are from, most Zombies wouldn't harm them.

When confronted with a Zombie it doesn't have to be dangerous, even though most danger within the Valley comes from Zombies.


Terniten's Geography
--------------------

Moko and Tira disagree about how the portals are spaced out across the geography of The Valley.



Tera's Collection
-----------------

Tera visits a storage where all of her unused paintings get stored.
She reflects upon the love that she feels for Xite, who features in many paintings,
and the fear for her own power.


Tirion Should Live
------------------

Tera tries to convince Moko to use his power and sentence Tirion to death, before he becomes a tyrant.
Moko can't come to the conclusion Tirion needs to die, because he has always been open about his own intentions,
which haven't been malicious.
Tirion deserves a chance to come to the understanding that he's astray and should come back to the path of peace.


Moko Should Die
---------------

Not long after Moko's judgement that Tirion deserves a second chance, Tirion orders Burte to kill Moko, which she does without hesitation.


The Zombie Orgy
---------------

Moko and Tera find Xite in the middle of an ongoing orgy,
where many savage Tera's are competing for the love of Xite,
who doesn't stop them from their endless giving.
As Moko and Tera watch from a distance they see a jaleous Tera lose her temper and strike at Xite.
Out of reflex the man ends her life leaving a cloud of dust.
Any savage Tera that opposes him doesn't stand a chance, even if Xite wanted to.
Seeing the scene enrages the civilised Tera and she steps out into the open to confront him.
