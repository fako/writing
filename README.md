Creative Writing
================

I've always had a large drive to create. 
Writing is a medium that I love to use for creating and this repository is a way to save that writing.


What's new
----------

Currently I'm working on [the plot of the first book](main/plot1.md) of the story that is slowly developing in my head.
A first sketch of the plot of all three parts are described in [the trilogy plot](main/plot-trilogy.md).
You're welcome to read these plots and give feedback on where the story is going. That would help me a lot.


What's coming
-------------

I'll be writing short stories that touch upon the characters, events and themes outlined in the setting.
These short stories will be glimpses on the larger story that I want to tell.
