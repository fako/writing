Creative Writing
================

I've always had a large drive to create. 
Writing is a medium that I love to use for creating and this repository is a way to save that writing.


What's new
----------

Currently I'm working on [the setting](setting/index.md) in which I want to tell the story that is slowly developing in my head.
You're welcome to read it and give feedback on where the story is going. That would help me a lot.


What's coming
-------------

I'll be writing short stories that touch upon the characters, events and themes outlined in the setting.
These short stories will be glimpses on the larger story that I want to tell.
