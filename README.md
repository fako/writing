Creative Writing
================

I've always had a large drive to create.
Writing is a medium that I love to use for creating and this repository is a way to save that writing.


What's new
----------

Currently I'm working on [a fictive world](setting/the-valley.md) that acts as the [setting](setting/index.md) of the story,
that is slowly developing in my head.
A first sketch of the plot of all three parts is described in [the trilogy plot](main/plot-trilogy.md).
You're welcome to read these plots and give feedback on where the story is going. That would help me a lot.


What's coming
-------------

I'll be writing short stories that touch upon the characters, events and themes outlined in the setting.
These short stories will be glimpses on the larger story that I want to tell.
