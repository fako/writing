Heaven and Hell
===============

I want to put these ancient concepts into a modern perspective.
In my view these words don't describe places, but states of being.
Hell is a state of discomfort, while heaven is a state of bliss.


Hell
----

Hell is a state of discomfort.
Physical injury or being neglected are good examples,
everybody who experiences it to a sufficient degree will be uncomfortable or even suffer.

The bad news is that hell is not under our control.
No matter how much we want hell to disappear it will eventually surface in our lives in some form.
The key is to avoid hell as much as possible and to seek relieve when it strikes us.
It's not in our capability to never feel hungry again,
but we can, to the best of our capabilities, feed ourselves to prevent or soothe it.

The good news is that our society organizes itself to prevent hell from entering lives.
Everybody striving away from hell leads to a society that fascilitates that desire.

Escaping hell may feel like such a relieve that we mistake it for heaven.
However, heaven is different from avoiding hell.


Heaven
------

Heaven is best described as what it is not.
It is not doing whatever you want,
because that would mean that eventually you run into hell.
Instead we need a regular life, with many good habits, in a functional society
that works well to avoid hell.
At the same time we need to experience these habits, regularity and perhaps obligations not as boring, but as a blessing.
Not only in theory, but we actually need to feel them as such.
Because if it's only our mind that decides that regularity is good for us,
then we are missing out on the neurological benefits that true happiness gives us.
For instance our memory functions better when we are truly happy.
These kinds of benefits will not come into your life if for example, at the end of the day,
you simply sum up good things that happened to you that day.
Such a practice may help you to avoid hell, but avoiding hell is not the same as stepping into heaven.


Purgatory
---------

While some aspects of heaven can be quantified and proven, like the beneficial effects on memory of dopamine secreted while in bliss.
Most benefits of heaven are subjective and therefore many different habits can lead to a heavenly life.
This also means that what works for one person may not work for another.
And worse: what works for one person, another may come to experience as a hell.
This kind of hell that stems not only from the circumstances, because some people experience heaven under the same conditions,
but also from the mind and what an individual makes from those circumstances is purgatory.
It is unquestionably a hell for the people that experience it that way,
and it may be worthwhile to try to avoid this purgatory,
but one has to keep in mind that purgatory is temporal and time may soften the burn from it.

A good example of purgatory is the inability to fulfill a desire. 
These desires may differ wildly from person to person, because their desires are so different.
The inability to fulfill a particular desire may not be a problem at all for some individuals,
because their desire for it is low.
At the same time the people that do strongly desire something often have a particular idea about why that something is so desirable.
If over time the idea about why something is desirable changes in an individual,
somebody can go from purgatory into a more neutral place, which is neither heaven nor hell.


Gates of Hell
-------------

In the same way a person can step out of purgatory, by changing its perspective on the circumstances.
So too a person can actively seek for circumstances that it will experience as hell,
and willfully undergo these circumstances, in order to reach a goal.

One may for instance decide to defy bad whether to get to a party and enjoy oneself.
Going through bad wheather to get to a desireable destination is like walking through the gates of hell and back again.
Bad wheather is a rather trivial example, but a more fundamental one would be some forms of education.
Where the experience of being unable to do something, and the act of learning are initially uncomfortable,
but the gains after something has been learned is high.
Unfortunatly it can be hard to tell what the benefits are of stepping through the gates of hell,
until you spend a significant amount in suffering.
And once you step through it is not guaranteed that the benefits will outweigh the suffering,
so one needs to dance around the gates of hell a bit to see what works.


Devils
------

A devil can be a man or woman who pretends to be different than it actually is.
As long as somebody is not completely honest with itself and others the hell is not far away.
At some time reality kicks in and the self image that a devil has made of itself will break down,
revealing the hell that it was part of all along, despite its lies it told itself and others.
The worse kind of devil not only lies, but drags others into it and into hell.
Sadly devils may not always be aware that they are devils and unwillingly prolong suffering.
