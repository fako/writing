Sound of Iets
=============

A mantra with a ritual aiming to map how communities view God, Universe, Love.

An adaptation of "Listen to the sound"

Iets is a Dutch word that literally means "something".
It can be used in a sentence like: "I believe in something, but I don't know what exactly".
The ie sound corresponds with the 7th chakra and therefor using the word Iets has an energetic meaning.

```
1    I listen to the sound of Iets
2    and it has no name
3    I listen to the sound of Iets
4    and it has no words
5    I listen to the sound of Iets
6    and I can see
7    Iets is <mystery>
8    <mystery> is iets
```

In the ritual the word "mystery" gets replaced as the mantra gets repeated (see below).
A facilitator is encouraged to replace "mystery" with whatever fits the situation.
The words "love" or "wind" are probably just as good as "mystery" for instance.


Ritual
------

The group starts by singing the entire mantra using a word chosen by the facilitator ("mystery" is a suggestion).
After the first encantation somebody calls out a word that for that person fits.
Meaning that the person thinks the word says something thruthful about Iets.
Anybody who disagrees with the call can stay silence as line 7 gets song ("Iets is \<word\>").
It's expected that everybody agrees to what line 8 is saying, because most words represents something.

It would be nice if people log what has been called out by the group and share this with the bigger community.
Everything that gets called out should be noted and it's also interesting to know which words the majority of the group agreed with.
That way it will slowly become evident how people view Iets and which aspects they find important about it.
This data may show trends and change over time.

To give an idea about how a log could look like, here is a simple example:

```
Occassion: Concious Camping
Date: 3rd of July 2022
Suggestions: wind, heart, fire, drums, birds, stars, Iets
Truthful: wind, birds, stars, Iets
Facilitator: Fako Berkers
```
